<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="nodent"><a class="smcap">The</a> first edition of this
Grammar having been for many years exhausted, and a considerable
demand for some means of acquiring an accurate knowledge of the Maori
language having recently arisen, the author has been induced to
republish the work with such alterations as the attention which he has
in the meantime given to the subject, during long labours of
translation, has caused him to deem advisable.</p>

<p>Amongst the principal of these alterations is the omission of many
passages exhibiting extreme niceties of the language, which, although
useful to the finished scholar, were thought to be scarcely necessary
to the ordinary student, and were complained of as embarrassing to the
beginner.</p>

<p>The author begs to express his acknowledgments to his friend Mr.
Fenton, late Resident Magistrate of Waikato, and one of the few who
have studied the language grammatically, for carrying the present work
through the press.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.</h2>

<p class="nodent"><a class="smcap">Independently</a> of minute and
numerous subdivisions, it may, perhaps, be correct to state that there
are spoken in this the northern island seven leading dialects, each
more or less distinguished from the other&mdash;viz., 1st, the Rarawa,
or that spoken to the northward of Kaitaia; 2nd, the Ngapuhi, or that
spoken in that portion of the island as far south of Kaitaia as Point
Rodney on the eastern coast, and Kaipara on the western; 3rd, the
Waikato, or that spoken in the district lying between Point Rodney and
Tauranga on the east, and Kaipara and Mokau on the west; 4th, that
spoken in the Bay of Plenty; 5th, the dialect of the East Cape and its
neighbourhood, in which, perhaps, may be included that of Rotorua,
though in these two places many little differences might be detected;
6th, that spoken in the line of coast between Port Nicholson and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vi" id="page_vi">{vi}</a></span>
Wanganui, though here, also, at least four distinct branches might be
traced; 7th, and last, that spoken between Wanganui and Mokau. The
dialect of Taupo may be, perhaps, considered a mixture of those of
Rotorua and Waikato.</p>

<p>All these may be stated to bear to each other a remarkable radical
affinity. Many words, it is true, may be found in one which are
unknown in another; but the grammar of <i>any</i> will give a great
insight into the texture of <i>all</i>.</p>

<p>The Waikato dialect is very generally known throughout the larger
portion of the island. It has deeply tinctured that of Taupo, is well
known at Tauranga and the Bay of Plenty, and has been carried to the
summits of Taranaki by the multitudes whom its fierce warriors once
dragged from thence in slavery, and whose chains have been since
snapped by the power of the Gospel. Ngapuhi to the northward are well
acquainted with it, from the number of slaves who had been fetched
from thence by the warrior Hongi; and a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vii" id="page_vii">{vii}</a></span>
before his time it was
carried to the neighbourhood of Port Nicholson by two large and
distinct migrations&mdash;one by Ngatitoa, who were the original
possessors of Kawhia, another by Ngatiraukawa, who formerly occupied
Maungatautari, and as far as Taupo.</p>

<p>The four tribes also who now occupy the banks of the Thames resided,
formerly, for a very long period, in Waikato, and, being sprung from
the same stock, speak a language so similar that a critical ear can
scarcely tell the difference between the dialects of the two people.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_1" id="R_1" href="#F_1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>The origin of this people,&mdash;what part of this island was first
occupied,&mdash;whether it was not colonized by different migrations from
different islands,&mdash;are points as yet buried in darkness.</p>

<p>That it was not occupied by merely one migration has ever been the opinion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_viii" id="page_viii">{viii}</a></span>
the author since he heard of the different condition and
habits of the people of the East Cape and those of Waikato. A survey
of the different dialects will confirm the conjecture, and nowhere can
we get a better illustration than at Taupo. For that magnificent lake,
in the centre of the island, and the point of meeting for two parties,
as they approach from either coast, presents also a remarkable
diversity in the languages spoken on the eastern and western banks. On
the eastern, the dialect corresponds closely with that of Rotorua,
from which it is distant about a four days' journey; on the
north-western, which is occupied by a remnant left by the Ngatiraukawa
in their great migration to the southward, the dialect is remarkably
similar to that spoken in Waikato.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_2"
id="R_2" href="#F_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>The points of similarity between the fundamental principles of the
Hebrew language and those of Maori have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_ix" id="page_ix">{ix}</a></span>
occasionally noticed:
not, however, because the author entertains any opinion that the two
languages can claim any direct relationship to each other. Upon this
only would he insist, in reply to those who would bind him down to the
model of some of the European grammars, that Maori, like Hebrew, is
altogether different from those languages in structure; that every
subject of scientific inquiry must have rules and an arrangement
suited to its nature; and that, as it would be absurd to construct the
English on the basis of the Latin, so would it be more out of course
to think of finding in Maori declensions, conjugations, modes of
comparison, &amp;c., &amp;c., as accurately defined, or conducted on
the same principles, as those of languages so polished, and so adapted
for expressing, as well the minutest varieties in thought, as the
tenderest emotions of the feelings.</p>

<p>And here the author would acknowledge his obligations to Professor Lee
for his theory of the Hebrew tenses. On no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_x" id="page_x">{x}</a></span>
other hypothesis can a
satisfactory solution be given of the Maori tense.</p>

<p>The student is requested to notice that the remarks that are more
suited to a beginner are printed in large type, and that matters which
are of less importance to him are contained in the smaller. It will
be, perhaps, most advisable for him to omit the perusal of the latter
until he has mastered the former.</p>

Marutuahu, from Kawhia, is the great progenitor of the Thames tribes,
and his name is often used to designate that people. Kawhia, we may
add, is the place at which, according to the accounts of the people of
Waikato, Taranaki, as well as those of Ngatiruanui, the early
immigrants landed.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_2" id="F_2" href="#R_2">[2]</a>&#8195;
These remarks might also be extended to Rotorua lakes, on the
north-western extremity also of which are residing another remnant of
Ngatiraukawa, whose dialect is, as far as the author recollects,
different from that spoken by Ngatiwakaane.</p>

</table>

<p>The second and third head differ but little from each other, and it
sometimes may be difficult to decide under which of the two the sound
should be classed.</p>

<p>The reader is requested to notice that the distinctions above made,
are not founded so much on the length of the sound, as on the
differences of the sounds themselves. If the length of the sound be
considered, other classes, (at least two,) might easily be
established; but the learner would, we fear, be more perplexed than
benefitted by the addition.</p>

<p>The speaker should remember that in some compound words the last
syllable of the first word, if it end in a, is pronounced strong;
<i>e.&nbsp;g.</i></p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Patung&#257;-poaka; <i>place where pigs are killed</i>.
  Ma-hing&#257;-kai; <i>a cultivation</i>. Mat&#257;-pu; <i>the lead
  of a gun, a bullet</i>. Ta te tutu&#257; tu; <i>the plebeian's
  manners</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;There are
exceptions to this rule which it would be well for the student of
observation to notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_3" id="page_3">{3}</a></span>
In pronouncing such words as kata, mata, tata, the speaker must be
careful not to slur over the first <i>a</i>, as if it were
k<i>e</i>ta, m<i>e</i>ta, &amp;c. It should be pronounced clearly and
distinctly.</p>

<p class="center">E</p>

<p>Is pronounced as <i>a</i> in bate, hate, &amp;c., only not quite so
slow, or so broad. Perhaps the final <i>e</i> in the French words
café, felicité, would be a closer resemblance; e.&nbsp;g., koe, rea,
re, ket<i>e</i>, ma<i>te</i>, <i>te</i>nei, rer<i>e</i>.</p>

<p>(2.) As <i>e</i> in <i>poe</i>tical, <i>th</i>ere; e.&nbsp;g.,
<i>te</i>na, <i>ren</i>ga-<i>ren</i>ga, <i>ke</i>te, <i>re</i>re.</p>

<p class="small">Few sounds in Maori are more frequently
mis-pronounced by foreigners than <i>e</i>. To<i>he</i>, nga<i>re</i>,
ku<i>mea</i>, ho<i>ea</i> mai <i>te</i> waka, <i>te</i> reinga,
<i>te</i> rangi, rew<i>er</i>a, kor<i>er</i>o, have been all so
carelessly pronounced as to sound to the native ear as if spelt,
to<i>hi</i>, ngari, kumia, ho<i>ia</i> mai <i>ti</i> waka, <i>to</i>
reinga, <i>to</i> rangi, Rewara, kororo. The reader should also be
careful not to give <i>e</i> the dipthongal sound of ei; as in ne the
interrogative particle, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p>I is pronounced like the French <i>i</i>; as <i>ee</i> in sleep,
green, &amp;c.; when distinctly and fully pronounced it imparts much
melodiousness to the sentence; e.&nbsp;g. ar<i>i</i>k<i>i</i>,
k<i>&#299;</i>k<i>i</i>, <i>to chatter</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the following it has a shorter sound: k<i>&#301;</i>ki,
<i>crowded</i>; m<i>&#301;</i>ti, t<i>&#301;</i>ti, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="small">N. B.&mdash;The speaker should be careful not to
confound <i>i</i> with the Maori <i>e</i>; as in such words as
wakatoi, hoi, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="center">O</p>

<p>Has a long and a short sound, a long; as toto, <i>to drag</i>.</p>

<p>A short; as toto, <i>blood</i>.</p>

<p class="small">N. B.&mdash;We have no sound in Maori to correspond
to the o in <i>not</i>, <i>hot</i>, <i>pot</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4"
id="page_4">{4}</a></span>U</p>

<p>This sound is also uniform in kind, and always corresponds to
<i>oo</i> in b<i>oo</i>k, &amp;c. It sometimes, however, experiences a
more quick, sometimes a more slow pronunciation.</p>

<p>The following table exhibits two variations beginning with the
shorter:&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">In pronouncing <i>u</i> the speaker will have to
guard against the error of those who prefix the aspirate when no
aspirate is admissible. According to them <i>u</i>, <i>utu</i>,
&amp;c., are pronounced as if spelt <i>hu</i>, <i>hutu</i>.</p>

<p class="small">He will also have to beware of the more common and
stubborn error of giving <i>u</i> the dipthongal sound of <i>u</i> in
<i>cube</i>, <i>tube</i>, <i>mute</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;tonu, ketu,
tonutia, are, in this way, pronounced as if spelt ton<i>iu</i>,
toniutia, ketiu.</p>

<p class="small"><i>U</i>, again, is sometimes, by careless speakers,
confounded with <i>o</i>, and <i>vice versâ</i>. Thus ihu,
<i>nose</i>; niho, <i>tooth</i>; have been erroneously pronounced as
if spelt iho, nihu.</p>

<h3>OF THE DIPTHONGS.</h3>

<p>This portion of Maori literature has been as yet but little explored;
and as each person's notions will vary with the acuteness of his ear,
and the extent to which his judgment has been exercised, we may be
prepared to expect a considerable discrepancy of opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span>
We shall therefore proceed with caution, and offer only what may be
most useful, and most necessary for the student.</p>

<p>The field of discussion may be much limited if we first define what we
mean by the word "dipthong."</p>

<p>The best definition we can find, and the one most suited to the
nature of the dipthong, is, we think, that of Mr Smith, in Walker. "A
dipthong," he says, "I would define to be two simple vocal sounds
uttered by one and the same emission of breath, and joined in such a
manner that each loses a portion of its natural length; but from the
junction produceth a compound sound equal in the time of pronouncing
to either of them taken separately, and so making still but one
syllable."</p>

<p>Following this definition, three tests for a dipthong suggest
themselves.</p>

<p>1. The emission of the two sounds by the same breath.</p>

<p>2. Their amalgamation, or more correctly, their coalescing; for each
vowel in the Maori dipthong is distinctly heard.</p>

<p>3. The abbreviation of the natural length of each simple sound.</p>

<p>In applying these rules to the dipthongs, it will be perhaps most
prudent to divide them, under the present imperfect state of our
knowledge, into two classes. 1. The certain, or those of the
dipthongal character of which there can be but little question. 2. The
doubtful, or those upon which inquirers may be likely to entertain
different opinions.</p>

<p>The dipthongs which we consider certain, are as follows:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>aa, ae, ai, ao, au, ee, ei, ii, oo, ou, uu.</li>
</ul>

<p>On these we will offer a few remarks.</p>

<p>Those dipthongs which are formed by a double letter, such as
<i>aa</i>, are distinguished by a stronger and fuller sound; as in
Wakaaro, rap<i>uu</i>tu, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6"
id="page_6">{6}</a></span>AE</p>

<p>Is a sound for which it is difficult to find a parallel in English,
and which most speakers confound with <i>ai</i> in such words as
waewae, waeroa, paewae, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The English <i>aye</i> comes perhaps closer to it. It must be
pronounced broad and open, and care must be taken to keep out the
squeezed sound of the i.</p>

<p class="center">AI</p>

<p>May be well represented by the <i>i</i> in shine.</p>

<p class="center">AO</p>

<p>Has no representative in English that we are aware of. In pronouncing
it, the speaker must be careful to let the <i>o</i> be distinctly, but
not too prominently, heard; and considerable care will be required to
keep it distinct from <i>au</i> in the following words, as otawhao,
whawhao, tao, hao, &amp;c.: neither again must the speaker divide the
dipthong into two syllables, as some speakers do in otaota, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="center">AU</p>

<p>May be pronounced like ou in drought, trout, pound, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="center">EI</p>

<p>May be represented by the <i>ai</i> in <i>hail</i>, <i>pail</i>, &amp;c.
Care must be taken not to suppress altogether the <i>i</i>, as is
sometimes done in such words as ten<i>e</i>i, penei, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="center">OU</p>

<p>Is a sound of some difficulty. There is no sound that we are aware of
in the English language that exactly corresponds to it. Low, sow, mow,
&amp;c., may be made to resemble it, by pronouncing them slowly, and
letting the sound die away into <i>u</i>.</p>

<p class="small">Most foreigners are apt to pronounce it as a simple
<i>o</i>. The first syllable of <i>koutou</i> is one of very difficult
pronunciation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span>
Without great care it will be variously pronounced, as if koitou, kotou,
or kutu.</p>

<p class="small">By not attending to these distinctions the speaker
will often lose the benefit of a good thought. A speaker, guarding his
hearers against spiritual temptations, borrowed his illustration from
a <i>poukaka</i> (the perch for the parrot by which it is caught,)
telling them that Satan often presents poukakas to attract them to
ruin; unfortunately, however, instead of <i>pou</i>kaka he used
<i>po</i>kaka, <i>a squall of wind and rain</i>, and only expressed
his point by exciting their risibility.</p>

<p>The doubtful class of dipthongs are au, (as in mau, <i>for thee</i>,
tau, <i>thy</i>,) ai, (as in maia, <i>brave</i>) ea, eo, eu, io, iu.</p>

<p class="small">On these we do not wish at present to make many
observations. We believe that there is a considerable difference
amongst Maori speakers respecting them. Our own idea is, that there
may be a few occasions on which some might be considered dipthongs;
and that those occasions are, the position of the syllable, whether at
the end of the word, or elsewhere, as also whether it come under the
influence of the accent.</p>

<p class="small">We cannot dismiss this subject without mentioning two
particulars, very necessary to be remembered by all who wish to attain
to an accurate pronunciation of Maori. First, as it is in English,
every sentence is to be pronounced as if one word. 2. Homogeneous
vowels will, when they meet, almost always run into a dipthong.</p>

<p class="small">The following sentence, <i>koia i whiriwhiria ai e ia
to ratou uri</i>, would be thus pronounced by a native,
<i>koiai-whiri-whiriai-eia-to-ratouri</i>. <i>Koia ia i riri ai</i>
would run, <i>koiai-aiririai</i>.</p>

<p class="small">This subject of homogeneous vowels coalescing into
dipthongs, is one which has not received the attention it merits.</p>

<h3>OF THE CONSONANTS.</h3>

<p class="center">H.</p>

<p>This is the same as the English <i>h</i>.</p>

<p>It is not however known on the western coast of New Zealand to the
southward of Mokau, in the district of Taranaki. Its place is supplied
by a curious stammer or jirk of the voice. A gentle sibilancy
accompanies its pronunciation amongst Ngapuhi, which some speakers
erroneously confound with <i>sh</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8"
id="page_8">{8}</a></span>K.</p>

<p>K has the sound of the English <i>k</i>; as in kill, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="center">M. N. P.</p>

<p>M, N, P, have the same sound as in English.</p>

<p class="center">R.</p>

<p>R has two sounds: (1) rough; as in <i>rain</i>, <i>river</i>, &amp;c.;
e.&nbsp;g., kaho<i>r</i>e, <i>r</i>o<i>r</i>ea, roro, <i>r</i>oto.</p>

<p>(2) The second is more soft, and is formed by a gentle jar of the
tongue against the palate; so gentle indeed is the vibration, that
most foreigners pronounce it like <i>d</i> or <i>l</i>, as in
<i>r</i>aro, ru<i>r</i>u, <i>r</i>imu, poua<i>r</i>u, pa<i>r</i>i,
mu<i>r</i>i, ma<i>r</i>i<i>r</i>i, koi<i>r</i>i,
ko<i>r</i>iko<i>r</i>i, kou<i>r</i>u, ma<i>r</i>u.</p>

<p class="center">T.</p>

<p>This is a letter which few Europeans pronounce correctly. It is not
pronounced like the <i>t</i> in temper, tea, &amp;c.; but rather like the
sharp <i>th</i> of apa<i>th</i>y, sympa<i>th</i>y, A<i>th</i>ens,
apo<i>th</i>ecary. Those who watch a native's tongue while pronouncing
this letter, will find that the rule for attaining this sound is, to
apply the tongue, not to the root, but to the top of the teeth, and
hardly emit <i>a</i>.</p>

<p class="center">W.</p>

<p>Has two sounds, one simple, as that in wind, &amp;c., e.&nbsp;g., wai,
<i>water</i>, waka, <i>a canoe</i>, ware, <i>a plebeian</i>.</p>

<p>2. An aspirated <i>w</i>, as in when, where, &amp;c.; whai, <i>follow</i>,
whare, <i>a house</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="center">NG.</p>

<p>The speaker should be careful, in uttering this sound not to separate
the <i>n</i> from the <i>g</i>, as is sometimes done by foreigners.
The <i>n</i> and <i>g</i> intimately coalesce, and those who have
learned to pronounce the French <i>encore</i> will find no difficulty
in catching it. The following rule will, we trust, help the beginner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span>
Press the middle of the tongue to the roof of the mouth, near the
throat, and simultaneously relax the pressure, and pronounce na. Of
course care must be taken that the tip of the tongue does not touch
the palate.<span

<h2><span class="fs80">CHAPTER II.</span><br />
OF THE ARTICLE.</h2>

<p>§ 1. The articles in Maori are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(a.) The definite article <i>te</i> and its plural <i>nga</i>;
e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>te</i> tangata, <i>the man</i>.</li>
  <li><i>nga</i> tangata, <i>the men</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(b.) The indefinite articles <i>he</i>, <i>tetahi</i>, and its
plural <i>etahi</i>; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>Sing.</i> <i>he</i> maripi, <i>a knife</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Plur.</i> <i>he</i> maripi ena? <i>are those knives</i>?</li>
  <li><i>te tahi</i> maripi, <i>a knife</i>.</li>
  <li><i>e tahi</i> maripi, <i>knives</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(c.) The arthritic particles <i>a</i> and <i>ko</i>; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>a Hone, <i>John</i>.</li>
  <li>ko koe, <i>you</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>§ 2. <i>Te</i> is not so uniformly definite as the English <i>the</i>;
being sometimes used;</p>

<p>(a.) Where no article would be employed in English, i.&nbsp;e., in cases
where the noun is taken in its widest sense; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>I ma <i>te</i> kaipuke, <i>went by ship</i>.</li>
  <li>He kino <i>te</i> tutu, <i>disobedience is sinful</i>.</li>
  <li>Ko <i>te</i> rangi me <i>te</i> wenua e pahemo, <i>Heaven and
    earth shall pass away</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(b.) Sometimes it is employed instead of the English <i>a</i>;
e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>He mea kaha <i>te</i> hoiho, <i>a horse is a strong thing</i>.</li>
  <li><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span>
      E kore <i>te</i> tangata tika e wehi i <i>te</i> mate, <i>a virtuous
      man fears not death</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(c.) Sometimes it is used instead of the pronoun <i>some</i>; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Kei tahaetia e <i>te</i> tangata, <i>lest it should be stolen by
    some person</i>; na <i>te</i> tangata noa atu, <i>by some person
    or other</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(d.) It is employed for many other purposes which the English
<i>the</i> does not recognize. We shall only mention the following;</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>Te</i> tini o te kaipuke, <i>How many ships there are</i>!</li>
</ul>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;It has been
asserted that <i>te</i> is sometimes used in the plural number, as in
the preceding example, "<i>te</i> kaipuke," and in the following;
<i>te</i> tini o te tangata, <i>many men</i>; ka reka <i>te</i>
pititi, <i>peaches are sweet</i>.</p>

<p class="small">We are more inclined to think that we have, in these
examples, the operation of a figure of frequent occurrence in Maori,
viz., synecdoche, and that one of a class is made to represent a whole
class.</p>

<p class="small">Expressions of this kind are common in English,
without involving the plural number of the article; e.&nbsp;g., <i>the
fruit of the tree</i>, <i>a great many</i>, <i>a few men</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> Bishop Lowth's remarks on these instances are quite to
the point.</p>

<p class="small">"The reason of it, he says, is manifest from the
effect which the article has in these phrases; it means a small or
great number, collectively taken, and therefore gives the idea of a
whole, that is, of unity. Thus likewise, <i>a hundred</i>, <i>a
thousand</i> is one whole number, an aggregate of many collectively
taken; and therefore still retains the article <i>a</i>, though joined
as an adjective to a plural substantive; as, <i>a hundred
years</i>."</p>

<p>(e.) Lastly, <i>te</i> is sometimes employed before proper
names; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>Te Puriri</i>, <i>Te Uira</i></li>
</ul>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note 1.</span>&mdash;To define
the rule by which the article is prefixed or omitted before proper
names is a work of some difficulty, usage being very irregular.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note 2.</span>&mdash;Sometimes
<i>te</i> is blended with <i>o</i> into one word; as in the following
example: ki <i>to</i> Hone ware, to the house of John, instead of ki
<i>te</i> whare <i>o</i> Hone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span></p>
<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note 3.</span>&mdash;The student
should be careful, in speaking, to distinguish between the article
<i>te</i>, and the negative particle <i>te</i>. The latter should
always be pronounced more distinctly and forcibly than the article.</p>

<p>§ 3. <i>Nga</i> may with strict propriety be called the
plural of the definite article. There are a few exceptions,
or rather slight variations, which we do not think
it necessary to mention.</p>

<p>§ 4. <i>He</i> varies in some respects in its uses from the
English <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>(a.) It is used sometimes where no article would be
employed in English; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>A, ho atu ana e ratou <i>he</i> moni ki a ia, <i>and they gave him
    money</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(b.) It is occasionally used in the same sense as <i>some</i>
in English, e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>kawea he wai, <i>fetch some water</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(c.) It is used in the plural number, e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>He uwha kau aku poaka, <i>my pigs are all females</i>.</li>
  <li><i>He</i> tini oku kainga, <i>my farms are many</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>§ 5. A great many uses of the indefinite article are
shared by <i>he</i> with <i>te tahi</i>. We shall mention here a
few of them.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Ho mai <i>te tahi</i> maripi, <i>give me a knife</i>.</li>
  <li>Tahuna mai <i>te tahi</i> rama, <i>kindle a light</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="small">N.B.&mdash;<i>Te tahi</i> exactly corresponds with
the definition given by Bishop Lowth of the English article <i>a</i>.
"It determines it (the thing spoken of) to be one single thing of the
kind, leaving it still uncertain which." A similar use of the numeral
<i>one</i> we find in French, sometimes in Hebrew, and more than once
in the New Testament; (vid. Mat. xxi. 19, and Mark xiv. 51.)</p>

<p class="small">We need not look abroad for parallel instances; our
indefinite article <i>an</i> being, as every etymologist is aware, the
Saxon article, which signifies <i>one</i>.</p>

<p>(b.) <i>Etahi</i> may be considered as corresponding to the partitive
article <i>des</i> of the French. It determines the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span>things spoken of to be any number of
things of the kind, leaving it uncertain how many, or which, of the
things they are. It closely resembles the adjective <i>some</i> of English,
and we enumerate it here among the articles because it only differs
from <i>te tahi</i> (which is clearly an article) in being its plural;
e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Maku e tahi ika, <i>give me some fish</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>§ 6. <i>A</i><span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_4" id="R_4"
href="#F_4">[4]</a></span> is a regular attendant on the personal
pronouns; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>a koe, <i>you</i>; ki a ia, <i>to him</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(b.) It is also the article by which the names of individuals
and tribes are always preceded; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>a Hone, kei <i>a</i> Hone <i>with John</i>; i <i>a</i> Ngapuhi.</li>
</ul>

<div class="small">
<p><span class="smcap">Note 1.</span>&mdash;When the particle
<i>ko</i> is prefixed to either the proper name, or the pronoun,
<i>a</i> is omitted; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
   <li><i>ko</i> Hone, <i>ko</i> ia.</li>
</ul>

<p>(2) It is also omitted after the prepositions <i>e</i>, <i>ma</i>,
<i>mo</i>, <i>no</i>, <i>na</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>a</i>. The prepositions
with which it is retained are <i>i</i>, <i>ki</i>, <i>kei</i>, and
their compounds&mdash;i runga i, &amp;c.; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
   <li>i runga i a Hone, <i>above John</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="smcap">Note 2.</span>&mdash;Europeans who have not
made the language a study, often very incorrectly substitute <i>e</i>
for <i>a</i> before a proper name; e.&nbsp;g., they will say, <i>kei
hea e</i> te Waru, where is <i>te Waru</i>, and again kua
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span>
tae mai <i>e Nanaia</i>, <i>Nanaia has arrived</i>. <i>E</i>, as we
shall show hereafter, is the sign of the vocative case. A is omitted
before such words as the following, kei nga <i>Pakeha</i>, kei nga
<i>Maori</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note 3.</span>&mdash;<i>A</i> is sometimes in
Waikato prefixed to appellatives; e.&nbsp;g. ki <i>a</i> tuahangata,
<i>a</i> papa, <i>a</i> kara.</p>
</div>

<p>(c.) A is also prefixed to the <i>names of places</i>, and to
<i>prepositions</i>, and <i>adverbs</i> which have assumed the form
of substantives, when in the nominative case; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Kua horo <i>a</i> Pukerangiora, <i>Pukerangiora</i> (the fort)
    <i>has been stormed</i>. Kua tukua atu e ahau <i>a</i> Whangarei
    mo Hone, I <i>have given Whangarei to John</i>. Kua kainga
    <i>a</i> runga o nga puka nei, <i>the tops of the cabbage have
    been eaten off</i>.</li>
  <li>A hea? <i>what place?</i> A Rangitoto.</li>
</ul>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Sometimes
<i>a</i> is prefixed to the name of the place when the people of the
place, and not the place itself, are intended; e.&nbsp;g. ka mate i a
Waikato, <i>will be killed by Waikato</i>.</p>

<p class="small">Some speakers are often guilty of solecisms from not
remembering that <i>a</i> is not prefixed to any of the <i>oblique</i>
cases of the names of places. Thus we heard some old residents in the
land say, Haere ki <i>a</i> Pokuru, <i>Go to Pokuru</i>. Haere ki
<i>a</i> Waitemata, <i>Go to Waitemata</i>. According to this form
<i>Pokuru</i>, and <i>Waitemata</i> are not places, but persons.</p>

<p>(d.) A is always prefixed to any <i>inanimate thing</i> to which a
name has been given; i.&nbsp;e. to <i>trees</i>, <i>canoes</i>,
<i>ships</i>, <i>boats</i>, <i>meres</i>,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_5" id="R_5" href="#F_5">[5]</a></span> <i>guns</i>, &amp;c.;
e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Kei te tua i <i>a</i> Ruhaia, <i>he is cutting down (the tree)
  Ruhaia</i>. E waihape ana a Karapaina, <i>Columbine is tacking</i>.
  Mo to tahaetanga i a Pahikoura <i>for your having stolen (the

  <li>I toa ai a Hongi i whakawirinaki ia ki tana pu ki <i>a</i>
  Tanumia, <i>Hongi was brave because he trusted in his gun
  Tanumia</i>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="small">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Stars also come under the
operation of this rule, e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">

</ul>

<p>Houses, Caves, and such like, are regulated by rule (c), e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Heoi ano nga tangata <i>kei</i> a Puru o Waikato, <i>all the
  people have mustered off to Puruowaikato&mdash;Wherowhero's house on
  the Waikato river</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the above rules be correct&mdash;and we are persuaded that the candid
inquirer will assent to them, the following remarks may, perhaps, be
worthy the consideration of our Missionary brethren.</p>

<p>1st. We think that we are distinctly warranted by the analogy of the
language to treat the books of the Old and New Testaments as proper
names, and prefix <i>a</i> to them; as in the following examples, kei
a Kenehi, kei a Roma. Such portions however, as the Psalms, the Law,
the Acts, the Revelations, &amp;c., might, we think, be most safely
considered as appellatives. Such an usage has obtained in English,
and will not, we believe, be thought a novelty in Maori, by any one
who attends to such sentences as the following:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Kowai hei whakahua i ta tatou whangai hau?</li>
  <li>I a wai? i <i>a</i> Tu.</li>
  <li>Ko hea te haua mai na? ko Puhimatarenga, &amp;c.</li>
</ul>

<p>2. The following sentences are incorrect:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>E haere mai <i>ana te Mihaia</i>.</li>
  <li>Kua mate te Karaiti.</li>
</ul>

<p>N.B.&mdash;The speaker should distinguish between the article, and
the preposition <i>a</i>; as in the following sentence:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Ekore ahau e kai i <i>a</i> nga taurekareka, <i>I will not eat
  (the food) of the slaves</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The preposition <i>a</i> in these elliptical sentences should always
be pronounced peculiarly strong.</p>

<p>He should also note the following;</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>ki&#259; mea (with <i>short a</i>) is, "<i>to do</i>."</li>
  <li>ki &#257; mea (with <i>long a</i>) is, <i>to such an one</i>,
  <i>to our friend</i>, or in common parlance, (give it) <i>to what do
  ye call him</i>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_4" id="F_4" href="#R_4">[4]</a>&#8195;
Some perhaps may object to our regarding <i>a</i> as an article, and
may remind us of the definition that an article is "a word prefixed to
substantives to point them out, and show how far their signification
extends." This however is to make rules precede investigation, and our
reply is, that if Bishop Lowth, from whom this definition is derived,
had been writing on the Greek article, he would, most probably, have
never given such a definition. Every scholar is aware of the disputes
that have been agitated among the learned respecting the uses of this
article, and that some have even maintained "that its use is guided by
no rule at all." The fact is, every language has its peculiarities,
and it would be absurd to maintain that because any given part of
speech has certain powers in one language, it must have the same in
another.</p>

<p class="nodent">We denominate this article <i>arthritic</i>, because
it is, as the Greeks would say, an <i>arthron</i>, a <i>limb</i> of
the word to which it is prefixed, though it in no way defines the
extent of its signification; unless perhaps we consider that, by its
denoting the word to be either a pronoun, a proper name, &amp;c., it
thus, in a certain measure, restricts its application, and thus
accords with the definition which some writers would give of the
article; viz., "an index to the noun."</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_5" id="F_5" href="#R_5">[5]</a>&#8195;
The mere is a native weapon for war made of the axe stone. It is an
article of great value, and descends from father as an <i>oha</i>, an
heirloom in the tribe.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_6" id="F_6" href="#R_6">[6]</a>&#8195;
Tawera is the morning star.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_7" id="F_7" href="#R_7">[7]</a>&#8195;
This star makes his appearance about the month of June, in the first
month of the New Zealander, and creates an important epoch in his
agricultural operations.</p>

<h2><span class="fs80">CHAPTER III.</span><br />
OF THE NOUNS.</h2>

<h3>CLASSES OF NOUNS IN RESPECT TO ORIGIN.</h3>

<p>Nouns in Maori may be comprised under three
classes, <i>primitive</i> and <i>derivative</i>, and <i>verbal</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_8" id="R_8" href="#F_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>(a.) <i>Nouns primitive</i> are those which designate
<i>animals</i>, <i>plants</i>, <i>numbers</i>, <i>members</i> of the
animal body, some of the <i>great objects of the natural world</i>.</p>

<p class="small">N.B.&mdash;It is often impossible to distinguish
between primitive and derivative nouns.</p>

<p>(b.) <i>Nouns derivative</i>, which are altogether the most
numerous, comprise,</p>

<p>1st. Nouns derived from verbs, i.&nbsp;e., the verb, in its simple form,
used as a noun; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>He noho noa iho taku, <i>it is a simple sitting of mine</i>; <i>I
    have no fixed object in stopping</i> (here.)</li>
  <li>He haere pai to haere? <i>Is your going a good going</i>, i.&nbsp;e.,
    <i>are you going with good intent?</i></li>
</ul>

<p>(2.) Nouns derived from <i>adjectives</i>; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>He aha te <i>pai</i> o tena mea? <i>what is the worth of that
  thing?</i></li>
  <li><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span>
  Keihea te <i>pakaru</i>, <i>where is the broken place</i>?</li>
</ul>

<p>(3.) Nouns derived from adverbs and prepositions, e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>He <i>kore</i> rawa, it is nil.</li>
  <li>Engari a <i>reira</i> e pai ana, <i>there</i> (or that place) <i>is
    better</i>.</li>
  <li>Kua ki <i>a roto</i>, <i>the inside is full</i>.</li>
  <li>Parua <i>a tua</i>, <i>coat the other side</i> (with raupo.)</li>
</ul>

<p>(4.) <i>Compound Words.</i> These are always formed by two words
placed in immediate juxta-position, without any elision of either;
e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Hia kai, (<i>desire food</i>) <i>hunger</i>; mate moe,
  (<i>craving sleep</i>), <i>sleepiness</i>; hoa riri, (<i>angry
  friend</i>), <i>enemy</i>; mahi atawhai, (<i>cherishing act</i>,
  <i>&amp;c.</i>) <i>a cherishing</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>; kai whakaako,
  (<i>one that teaches</i>) <i>a teacher</i>; kai whakamarie, (<i>one
  that pacifies</i>) <i>a pacifier</i>; tangata atua, <i>a man having
  a God</i>; tangata pakeha, <i>a man having a European to live with
  him</i>; he hunga kainga, <i>a people having a place to reside
  on</i>; ahu taonga (<i>bent on gain</i>) <i>avariciousness</i>; ahu
  whenua, (<i>having the mind occupied with the earth</i>)
  <i>industriousness</i>, or <i>peaceableness</i>; whenua rangatira,
  (<i>a noble land, not disturbed by invasions</i>) <i>peace</i>;
  houhanga rongo, <i>making peace</i>; ngakau whakakake, <i>pride</i>;
  he whare kore, (<i>a no house</i>) <i>homelessness</i>; he horoi
  kore (<i>a no soap</i>) <i>soaplessness</i>; whakaaro kore,
  <i>thoughtlessness</i>, <i>&amp;c</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(c.) Verbal nouns are well worthy of the attention of the critical
student. They are of very extensive uses in Maori, and a proper
introduction of them will give animation and elegance to the sentence.
The rules for their formation will be found hereafter. See verbs.</p>

<p>They are generally employed to denote <i>time</i>, <i>place</i>,
<i>object</i>, <i>means</i>, or some <i>accompaniment</i> on, or
<i>relation</i> of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18"
id="page_18">{18}</a></span>the <i>act</i>, or <i>quality</i> of the
ground form.&mdash;Other uses of them will be mentioned in the
syntax.</p>

<p>To set forth the various uses of the verbal noun here would carry
us beyond our limits. We shall therefore only give a few
examples;&mdash;sufficient, however, we trust to lead the critical
student into more extensive inquiry;</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Ko tona moenga tena, <i>that is where he slept</i>.</li>
  <li>Te pumautanga o te Whakaaro, <i>the full assurance of hope</i>; te
    whakangarungarunga o te wai, <i>the troubling of the water</i>.</li>
  <li>Te peheatenga i meatia ai, <i>the manner in which it was done</i>.</li>
  <li>Te patunga poaka, <i>the place where the pigs are killed</i>.</li>
  <li>Kahore aku kete kumara hei whakahokinga atu mo to puka, <i>I have no
    basket of kumara with which to send back</i>, (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, <i>to
    pay for the loan of</i>) <i>your spade</i>.</li>
  <li>I te hanganga o te ao, <i>when the world was made</i>.</li>
  <li>I ana inoinga, <i>in his prayers</i>, (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, <i>when he
    prayed</i>.)</li>
  <li>Ko tona kiteatanga tenei, <i>this is the opportunity for looking
    for, or seeing, it</i>.</li>
  <li>To tatou nuinga, <i>the rest of our party</i>.</li>
  <li>I taku oranga, <i>while I live</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Instances will
sometimes occur in which the simple root, or the verbal form, may be
indifferently used in the sentence. The critical student, however,
will generally be able to see the reason; e.&nbsp;g., te <i>here</i> o
tona hu, <i>the thong of his shoe</i>; te <i>herenga</i> o tona hu,
<i>the holes, &amp;c., by which the thong is fastened</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Proper Names</span> should, perhaps, have been
classed under the head of <i>derivative nouns</i>.</p>

<p>They are epithets arbitrarily assumed, as among the Hebrews, from
some <i>circumstance, quality, act, or thing</i>. Sometimes they are
simple; e.&nbsp;g., ko te Tawa, <i>Tawa</i> (<i>a tree</i>). Sometimes
compound; e.&nbsp;g., Tangikai, <i>cry</i> <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_19" id="page_19">{19}</a></span><i>for food</i>. They are
generally known by <i>a</i> prefixed; when <i>a</i> is not prefixed, by the
context.</p>

<div class="small">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Sometimes we meet with
English appellatives employed as appellatives in Maori, but with the
form peculiar to proper names; e.&nbsp;g., a mata, <i>the
mistress</i>; a pepi, <i>the baby</i>; a tekawana, <i>the
governor</i>. These, however, must be regarded as solecisms, and as in
no way supported by Maori analogy.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_9"
id="R_9" href="#F_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>We sometimes also meet with a Maori proper name employed as an
appellative; i.&nbsp;e., If an individual of a particular district has
been remarkable for any quality, his name will often be predicated of
any other in whom the same feature of character is discernible: thus,
Ropeti, of Waikato, was remarkable for making a great show of
hospitality:&mdash;hence, to any person else who has been detected acting
in a similar way, it will be said, Ko Ropeti, There is Ropeti.</p>

<p>As all these terms are necessarily limited in their use to a
particular district, we need not notice them further.</p>
</div>

<h3>OF GENDER, NUMBER, AND CASE.</h3>

<p>Maori, we may premise, admits of no such thing as declension by
inflection, i.&nbsp;e., by a variation of the ground form. All the
relations, it is capable of expressing, are denoted by words, or
particles, <i>pre</i>fixed or <i>post</i>-fixed to the noun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gender of Nouns.</span>&mdash;Distinctions of
gender are but seldom recognized in Maori. Only two are ever noticed,
viz., the <i>masculine</i> and <i>feminine</i>. These are always
expressed by different words, e.&nbsp;g.</p>

<p>The distinction of sex in the other branches, is generally designated
by tane and wahine postfixed to the relation; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>hunaonga wahine, <i>daughter-in-law</i>.</li>
  <li>hungawai tane, <i>father-in-law</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span><span
class="smcap">Number.</span>&mdash;Substantives in Maori have
<i>two</i> numbers, singular and plural.</p>

<p>The <i>singular</i> is known by the singular articles <i>te</i>, and
<i>tetahi</i>, or by one of the singular pronouns connected with the
noun; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Te whare o Hone, <i>the house of John</i>.</li>
  <li>Toku paraikete, <i>my blanket</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <i>plural</i> is known by (1) <i>nga</i>, <i>e tahi</i>, or (2)
one of the plural or dual pronouns preceding the noun; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>nga</i> wahine, <i>the women</i>.</li>
  <li><i>aku</i> tupuna, <i>my forefathers</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(3.) Sometimes the plural is designated by <i>o</i>, without
<i>te</i> preceding the noun; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>kei <i>o</i> Hone matua pea, <i>with John's uncles, perhaps</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(4.) In a few cases we meet with an alteration in the ground form;
e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Tamaiti, <i>son</i>; Tamariki, <i>sons, or children</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(5.) In some trissyllables, the first syllable of the plural is
pronounced long; as in matua, tupuna, wahine, tangata.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Examples of
these two latter heads are not of frequent occurrence.</p>

<p>(6.) We frequently meet with <i>ma</i> joined to the proper name, in a
sense corresponding to hoi <i>amphi</i>, and hoi <i>peri</i> in Greek,
to denote <i>the person and his company</i>: e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Kei a Kukutai <i>ma</i>, <i>with Kukutai and his party</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(7.) Sometimes also <i>ma</i> is in the same sense postfixed
to appellatives; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>E mara ma! E hoa ma! E ko ma!</li>
</ul>

<p>(8.) Sometimes an <i>act oft repeated</i>, or many things
of the <i>same kind</i> are denoted by a reduplication of one
or more syllables; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Kakata, <i>a frequent laughing</i>.</li>
  <li>Mamahi, <i>over-work</i>.</li>
  <li>Kimokimo, <i>a winking of the eyes</i>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="small">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22"
id="page_22">{22}</a></span><span class="smcap">Case.</span>&mdash;The
distinction of case in Maori is exceedingly simple. As it is not the
character of the language to decline either nouns or adjectives by a
variation of the termination, it is evident that, in this respect,
Maori is altogether different from Greek and Latin. Are we then to
adopt the cases that those languages so clearly need? We are aware
that some contend for them. But we are also assured that their
adoption would be, not only useless but often exceedingly perplexing.</p>

<p>It is true that prepositions may be found in Maori, as well as in
English, that correspond with the cases that are to be found in those
languages. But that, we submit, is not the question. Our business, we
conceive should be, to inquire how the dependence of words on each
other is denoted in Maori, and then look out for a system that will
meet, not a few selected cases, but all the various possible
conditions.</p>

<p>Now, in Maori, the different connexions and relations of one thing to
another are denoted by prepositions; there are upwards of twenty
prepositions; and these are capable of being much increased in number
by combination with each other; all having distinct meanings,
different relations, and therefore distinct cases. Are all these then
to be reduced to the six cases of Latin? Those who please may make
the experiment with the following; kei runga i te pouaka, kei te
kainga, ho atu ki a ia, me titiro atu ki a ia, patua ia ki te rakau,
hei tua i te whare, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The simple and comprehensive cases of Murray's English Grammar seem
therefore the best adapted for Maori, though we will confess that our
own judgment is against allowing any possessive case to Maori.</p>

<p>In English, it is true, that case may be recognised; because the
ground form undergoes a change to denote it. Even in Hebrew, something
analogous also might be admitted. But in Maori the possessive case is
expressed, like all the other oblique cases, by a preposition. It may
indeed be said, that in the pronouns we find a possessive formed by
inflection. But this might justly be questioned: for it is very
probable that <i>noku</i>, and <i>naku</i>, are compounds of no oku
and na aku, and, when a native speaks slowly, it may be observed that
he pronounces those words as if so spelt.</p>
</div>

<p>1. What is called the accusative case in Latin is most frequently
denoted by <i>i</i>. This particle is different from the preposition
<i>i</i>, and is only employed to denote the passing on of the action
of the verb to the noun; e.&nbsp;g., Ko wai hei keri <i>i</i> te mara?
<i>who is to dig the field?</i> (vid. prepositions <i>i</i>.)</p>

<p>2. The vocative case is always denoted by <i>e</i>; e.&nbsp;g., E Hone!
<i>O John!</i></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_8" id="F_8" href="#R_8">[8]</a>&#8195;
We are aware that <i>verbal</i> nouns should properly have been
classed under <i>derivative</i>; but as we shall often have to speak
of them as a distinct class, and as moreover they closely resemble, in
some respects, the participal form of the verb, and are very
frequently used instead of the finite verb itself, we have consulted
our convenience in thus distinguishing them.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_9" id="F_9" href="#R_9">[9]</a>&#8195;
It is true, that we have mentioned (Chap. II. § 6 notes) a few cases
which might seem to warrant such a use. But those clearly belong to a
different class.</p>

<h2><span class="fs80">CHAPTER IV.</span><br />
OF THE ADJECTIVE.</h2>

<p>Maori adjectives have no peculiar or appropriate form. They know no
distinction of gender, number, case, or comparison.</p>

<p>In common with substantives, adjectives admit often of
reduplication to denote <i>repetition, or many things the same
kind</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;vid. ch. 3, <i>number</i> § 8., e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Mahi kakata, <i>a frequent laughing</i>.</li>
  <li>He rakau kikino kau, <i>they are all bad trees</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Comparison in Maori is

<h2><span class="fs80">CHAPTER V.</span><br />
OF THE NUMERALS.</h2>

<p>Numerals in Maori abound in distinctions that are not to be met with
in other languages.</p>

<p>Tahi, one, has sometimes a form peculiar to itself, being prefixed by
<i>ko</i>. All between <i>tahi</i> and <i>tekau</i> may be prefixed by
<i>e</i>. All the simple numbers, i.&nbsp;e. all less than <i>ten</i>,
will, when preceding the higher numbers, take their ordinary prefixes;
e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>E rua, <i>two</i>&mdash;e rua rau, <i>two hundred</i>.</li>
  <li>Ka toru, <i>three</i>&mdash;ka toru nga rau, <i>three hundred, or it is
    300</i>.</li>
  <li>Kia wha, <i>let it be four</i>&mdash;kia wha mano, <i>let it be four
    thousand &amp;c.</i></li>
  <li>Ka rima <i>five</i>,&mdash;ka rima mano, <i>five thousand, &amp;c.</i></li>
  <li>Ka rima tekau, <i>fifty, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Numbers between ten and twenty are expressed by ten and unit; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>E ono, <i>six</i>,&mdash;tekau ma ono (<i>ten and six</i>)
     <i>sixteen</i>.</li>
  <li>E whitu, <i>seven</i>,&mdash;tekau ma whitu, <i>seventeen</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Twenty, and all numbers between twenty and a hundred, may be expressed
in two ways:</p>

<p>1st, (which is now the more general,) by a <i>unit</i> preceding ten;
e.&nbsp;g., e <i>ono</i> tekau, (<i>six tens</i>) <i>sixty</i>; ka
<i>iwa</i> tekau, <i>ninety</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2ndly, by <i>hoko</i> prefixed to the <i>unit</i>; e.&nbsp;g., hokorua
<i>twenty</i>.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25"
id="page_25">{25}</a></span> <span
class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The Maori mode of counting has
always, heretofore, been by pairs: thus <i>hokorua</i>, twenty, stands
for <i>twenty pair</i>, i.&nbsp;e. forty, and so on. When they wish it to
be understood singly they postfix <i>taki-taki</i> to the numeral
adjective; e.&nbsp;g., hokorua <i>taki-taki</i>, <i>twenty</i>.
Sometimes <i>topu</i>, or <i>pu</i>, is postfixed to make it more
clear that the double of the number is intended; e.&nbsp;g., e waru
topu, (<i>eight doubled</i>) <i>sixteen</i>.</p>

<p class="small">Ngahuru, with Ngapuhi, denotes <i>ten</i>, and tekau,
<i>eleven</i>. In this, the central part of the island, as far as
Taupo, ngahuru and tekau represent both of them <i>ten</i>.</p>

<p>In expressing a sum of <i>tens</i> and <i>units</i>, the smaller
number follows ten or its multiple, and is connected with it by the
numeral conjunction <i>ma</i>; e.&nbsp;g., <i>thirty-four</i> is denoted by
"e toru tekau ma wha."</p>

<p>In expressing a sum of <i>hundreds</i>, with <i>tens</i> and
<i>units</i>, the tens are postfixed to the hundreds without a
<i>ma</i> intervening; e.&nbsp;g., 136 is expressed by "ko tahi rau, e toru
tekau, ma ono."</p>

<p>A sum of <i>thousands</i>, <i>hundreds</i>, <i>tens</i> and
<i>units</i>, is expressed in the same way, the particle <i>ma</i>
only intervening between the <i>ten</i> and the <i>unit</i>; e.&nbsp;g.,
1136 is expressed by "ko tahi mano, ko tahi rau, e toru tekau, ma ono."</p>

<div class="small">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;It should be here noticed
that this is the new mode of reckoning brought in by Europeans, and
now fast spreading over the land. The old mode is not so convenient in
calculation; but it is often heard; 240 would according to it, be thus
expressed; Ko tahi rau ma rua, lit. <i>one hundred and two</i>. Two,
here, stands for (twice ten) twenty doubled.</p>

<p>250 would run thus, ko tahi rau ma rua pu tautahi, <i>one hundred
and two double</i>, and a tautahi, <i>an odd one</i>.</p>

<p>4900 would run thus; e rua mano ma wha, hokorima te tuma; <i>two
thousand, four hundred double, fifty double is the tuma, the
excess</i>.</p>

<p>For all beyond a thousand there is, we suspect, a considerable
diversity in the nomenclature of different tribes. In Waikato and
Taupo 10,000 double, (i.&nbsp;e., 20,000 according to our reckoning,) would
be a <i>tini</i>, ten <i>tini</i>, (i.&nbsp;e., 100,000 double) would be
indifferently called <i>ngera</i>, <i>rea</i>, <i>hea</i>. All beyond
that would be denominated by a <i>tini makehua</i>, a <i>tuaururi
whaioio</i>, (<i>or maioio</i>) a <i>tini whakarere</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26"
id="page_26">{26}</a></span>For denoting a number of persons less
than <i>ten</i>, <i>toko</i> is generally prefixed to the numeral;
e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>tokowhitu tatou, <i>we are seven in number</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For denoting <i>distribution</i> t&#257;taki is prefixed to the
numeral; kia <i>t&#257;taki</i> rua pu nga utu i te tangata, <i>let each
man have four payments</i>.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Tataki
prefixed does not always denote distribution; e.&nbsp;g., Ka
tataki-hia nga whakato o ta koutou mara? <i>How many baskets (are
these) that have been sown in your cultivation?</i></p>

<p>In measuring length, a fraction is denoted by huka; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>E ono whatianga, huka to te whitu, <i>It is six whatiangas<span

  <li>E waru maro<span class="fnanchor"><a
  href="#F_10">[10]</a></span>, huka to te iwa, <i>It is eight maro,
  not quite nine</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="smcap">Ordinals.</span>&mdash;The ordinal numbers are
formed:</p>

<p>1. By <i>tua</i> prefixed to the cardinal; e.&nbsp;g., tua toru,
<i>third</i>, tua iwa, <i>ninth</i>.</p>

<p>2. By <i>whaka</i> prefixed; e.&nbsp;g., whakatekau, <i>tenth</i>.</p>

<p>3. By the simple cardinal with the definite article, ko <i>te

<p>The first person dual and plural has, as may be seen in the above
table, two forms, <i>taua</i> and <i>tatou</i>, <i>maua</i> and
<i>matou</i>; the former class may be denominated <i>inclusive</i>,
the latter <i>exclusive</i>. For example:</p>

<p>The speaker of a company, who is addressing a
person just come in, uses <i>matou</i>; e tatari ana <i>matou</i> ki
a koe, <i>we are, or have been waiting for you</i>. If he
means that only himself and another have been waiting,
he uses <i>maua</i>, e tatari ana maua kia a koe: but when he
addresses the whole company he uses <i>tatou</i>; Tatou ki te
kai, <i>let us go to dinner</i>. If however he is addressing only<span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span>
another beside himself, he uses <i>taua</i>; Taua ki te kai, let us (two)
go to dinner. Again, if he says, No <i>matou</i> tenei kainga, he tells
you, the hearer, that he and others possess this farm. If he says, No
<i>maua</i> tenei kainga, he tells you that he and some other person
already mentioned possess it. If however he use <i>tatou</i>, No tatou
tenei kainga, he means that all that he is addressing have a share in
it. If he says, No taua tenei kainga, he tells you, the hearer, that
it belongs to you and himself.</p>

<div class="small">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The student will find
hereafter that the dual number is sometimes used for the plural.</p>

<p>In addressing an individual <i>ia</i> is sometimes used in the

<p>Pronouns, in common with nouns, have no gender. There is no word in
Maori to denote the pronoun <i>it</i> with its dual and plural. Their
place is generally supplied by some artifice of the construction, as
will be shewn in the Syntax.</p>

<h3>OF THE POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS.</h3>

<p>As the <i>possessive</i> pronouns are closely connected with
the <i>personal</i>, they may be mentioned next.</p>

<p>They are as follows:</p>

<table class="tbl" summary="possessive-prnouns-a">
 <tr class="center">
  <td class="small">SINGULAR.</td>
  <td class="small">PLURAL.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Toku, or t&#257;ku, or t&#259;ku, <i>my</i>.</td>
  <td class="left">Oku, &#257;ku, or &#259;ku, <i>my</i>.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Tou, to, or tau, <i>thy</i>.</td>
  <td class="left">Ou, o, au, <i>thy</i>.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Tona, t&#257;na, or t&#259;na, <i>his</i>.</td>
  <td class="left">Ona, &#257;na, &#259;na, <i>his</i>.</td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>The other possessive pronouns are formed from the dual and plural of
their respective pronouns by prefixing <i>o</i>; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>

<table class="tbl" summary="possessive-prnouns-b">
 <tr>
  <td>o</td>
  <td class="tall2" rowspan="2">{</td>
  <td>taua,</td>
  <td class="tall2" rowspan="2">}</td>
  <td><i>of us two</i>.</td>
  <td class="left">o</td>
  <td class="tall2" rowspan="2">{</td>
  <td>tatou,</td>
  <td class="tall2" rowspan="2">}</td>
  <td><i>our</i>.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td></td>
  <td>maua,</td>
  <td></td>
  <td class="left"></td>
  <td>matou,</td>
  <td></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td colspan="5">o korua, <i>of you two</i>.</td>
  <td class="left" colspan="5">o koutou, <i>your</i>.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td colspan="5">o raua, <i>of them two</i>.</td>
  <td class="left" colspan="5">o ratou, <i>their</i>.</td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>Such words as <i>himself</i>, <i>his own</i>, <i>my own</i>, &amp;c., are
expressed in Maori by some adverb added in the sentence; e.&nbsp;g., Nona
<i>ake ano</i> tona aroha ki a tatou, <i>his love to us was his
own</i>; i.&nbsp;e., was self-derived.</p>

<p>The adverbs most usually employed for this purpose are <i>ake</i>,
<i>ano</i>, <i>noa</i>, <i>iho</i>, <i>tonu</i>.</p>

<h3>RELATIVE PRONOUNS.</h3>

<p>The next in order are the relative pronouns. For these there is no
distinct form in Maori. Sometimes they are wholly omitted in the
sentence; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Ko te tangata tenei i patua e Hone, <i>this is the man that was
  beaten by John</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30"
id="page_30">{30}</a></span>At other times their place is supplied by
some artifice of the construction. Vid. S.</p>

<h3>DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS.</h3>

<p>The demonstrative pronouns are as follows: <i>Taua</i>, <i>tenei</i>,
<i>tena</i>, <i>tera</i>, and their respective plurals, <i>aua</i>,
<i>enei</i>, <i>ena</i>, <i>era</i>.</p>

<p><i>Tenei</i> and <i>aua</i> are used for <i>that</i> and
<i>those</i>. <i>Tenei</i> is applied to the object nearest at hand,
or to the point of discourse to which the speaker had last alluded;
<i>tena</i> to an object near to, or connected with, you the person
spoken to; <i>tera</i> to an object farther remote; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>No Hone tenei ware, <i>this is John's house</i>.</li>
  <li>No Penehamine tena, <i>that one near you</i>.</li>
  <li>No Kukutai tera, <i>that one farther off is Kukutai's</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The same distinction is to be observed in the plural number.</p>

<div class="small">
<p>It may be questioned whether tenei and its branches are not, like
<i>to</i>, (vid. article) compounded of two words, viz. <i>te</i> and
<i>nei</i>, &amp;c. They can always, at least, be resolved into them;
e.&nbsp;g., Ho mai tena mea, <i>give me that thing</i>, is the same as ho
mai te mea na. There is, however, a little difference in the uses of
these two forms which the attentive student will discover by
observation.</p>

<p><i>Nei</i>, <i>na</i>, and <i>ra</i>, are mostly added (like the ci,
and lá of French) to point at the object more forcibly.</p>

<p>When the speaker wishes to denote the object with
<i>familiarity</i>, <i>contempt</i>, &amp;c., he generally uses the
resolved form; e.&nbsp;g., Ka hinga ahau i te wakatakariri ki
<i>te</i> tangata <i>nei</i>, <i>I fall with anger at the fellow
here</i>.</p>

<p>Sometimes we meet with nei and its branches twice repeated; e.&nbsp;g.,
tenei na, tera ra.</p>

<p>Nei, &amp;c., are often used in asking questions; e.&nbsp;g., nei
na? <i>Is this it?</i> Ra ra? <i>Is that it?</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The speaker should be
careful in speaking not to confound this demi-pronoun with the
interrogative particle <i>Ne</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes we meet with <i>ia</i> used as a demonstrative, e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Tona wenua kai ha <i>ia</i>, <i>that is the very land of food</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="small"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31"
id="page_31">{31}</a></span><span
class="smcap">Note</span>&mdash;<i>Anei</i>, and <i>ara</i> are often
used by Ngapuhi for <i>enei</i> and <i>era</i>.</p>

<h3>THE INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS.</h3>

<p>The interrogative pronouns are <i>wai</i>, <i>aha</i>, <i>tehea</i>, and
its plural <i>ehea</i>, <i>kohea</i>, and sometimes, (particularly in
Waikato,) <i>pehea</i>.</p>

<p><i>Wai</i> is applied (1) to persons, and (2) to animals or things, as
<i>canoes</i>, <i>ships</i>, &amp;c., to which the name of a man has been
given, and is always the pronoun used in asking the question, What is
his name? It is sometimes applied to <i>countries</i>, &amp;c.; but, in
such cases <i>kohea</i> is the pronoun most frequently used.</p>

<p>The following are examples of the uses of <i>wai</i> and
<i>kohea</i>:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Ko wai tena? <i>Who is that?</i></li>
  <li>Na wai tenei? <i>Whose is this?</i></li>
  <li>Ko wai tena kuri? <i>Who is that dog?</i> i.&nbsp;e., what is his name?</li>
  <li>Ko wai tena poti? ko Wikitoria, <i>what boat is that?</i> ans.
    <i>Victoria</i>.</li>
  <li>Ko wai tona ingoa? <i>What is his name?</i></li>
  <li>Ko wai tena whenua? <i>What country is that?</i></li>
  <li>Kohea tenei? <i>What place is this?</i></li>
</ul>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Wai will
sometimes take the plural form by having <i>ma</i> postfixed;
e.&nbsp;g., Ko wai ma ena? <i>Who are they?</i></p>

<p><i>Aha</i> is applied to everything in which <i>kind</i> is denoted;
so also is <i>pehea</i> sometimes:</p>

<p class="center">EXAMPLES.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>He aha tena mea? <i>what (insect, animal, or thing) is that?</i></li>
  <li>Ko Hone aha? <i>which John was it?&mdash;(was it John the
  Baptist, or John the Apostle?)</i></li>
  <li>He aha a Erihapeti ki a Hone? <i>what (relation) is Elizabeth to
  John?</i></li>
  <li>Na te aha? <i>from what cause? (why?)</i></li>
  <li>Pehea ana to whakaaro? <i>what is your thought?</i> i.&nbsp;e.,
  <i>what do you think?</i></li>
  <li><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32"
  id="page_32">{32}</a></span>E taea te pehea? <i>what can be done?
  how can it be helped?</i></li>
  <li>He kai pehea tena kai? <i>what kind of food is that?</i></li>
</ul>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The above
sentence decides the right of <i>pehea</i> to be considered a pronoun.
Most of the compounds however of <i>hea</i>; such as, <i>kohea</i>,
<i>pehea</i>, <i>nohea</i>, <i>ihea</i>, <i>mohea</i>, &amp;c., ought
most probably to be considered as belonging to the class of
adverbs.</p>

<p class="small">The student will find, as we proceed, that the lines
of distinction between the various classes of pronoun, adverb,
preposition, noun, verb and adjective, are frequently but faintly
marked, and that the same word may be often noticed as standing in
four or five different ranks.</p>

<p>Tehea, and its plural ehea, is applied to <i>which</i> of a number,
and is used to denote <i>persons</i>, or <i>things</i>; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Ko tehea tau e pai ai? <i>which do you choose?</i></li>
  <li>Ko ehea tangata au e ki nei, <i>which men do you speak of?</i></li>
</ul>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Pronouns are
sometimes employed to denote the time of the sentence, as will be seen
hereafter. (vid. verbs.)</p>

<h3>THE DISTRIBUTIVE PRONOUNS.</h3>

<p><i>Each</i> and <i>every one</i>, are expressed by the demonstrative
or possessive pronoun, and the noun twice or thrice repeated; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Haria mai e tera tangata, e tera tangata, tana kono riwai, <i>bring
    each man his basket of potatoes</i>.</li>
  <li>Ia tangata ia tangata, <i>each man</i>.</li>
  <li>I tenei ra i tenei ra, <i>each day</i>.</li>
  <li>E warea ana ki tana mahi ki tana mahi, <i>each is engaged with his
    own particular business</i>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>THE INDEFINITE PRONOUNS.</h3>

<p><i>Some other</i> and <i>any</i>, are most frequently denoted
by <i>te tahi</i>, and its plural <i>e tahi</i>; sometimes also by the
preposition <i>i</i>; (vid. prepositions.)</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Kua kite ahau i <i>e tahi</i>, <i>I saw some (of them)</i>.</li>
  <li>Ko <i>e tahi</i> kihai i kitea e ahau, <i>some I did not see</i>.</li>
  <li>Kahore kau ahau i kite i <i>te tahi</i>, <i>I did not see any at
  all</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33"
id="page_33">{33}</a></span><i>Whatever</i>, <i>whatsoever</i>,
&amp;c., are expressed in various ways; as may be seen in the
following examples:</p>

<h2><span class="fs80">CHAPTER VII.</span><br />OF THE VERBS.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_11" id="R_11" href="#F_11">[11]</a></span></h2>

<p>§ 1. <span class="smcap">Classification.</span>&mdash;They may be
distributed in</p>

<p>(a) <i>Primitive</i>, i.&nbsp;e., underived from other words; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Noho, <i>to sit</i>.</li>
  <li>Hopu, <i>to catch</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(b) <i>Derivative</i>, i.&nbsp;e. such as are derived from words of
some other root; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>E <i>kakahu</i> ana i tona, <i>is putting on his garment</i>.</li>
  <li><i>I ahatia</i> koe? <i>what was done to you?</i></li>
  <li>Penatia, <i>do it in that manner</i>.</li>
  <li>E hau, <i>if it blow</i>.</li>
  <li>Narungatia mai, <i>push it in from above</i>.</li>
  <li>E pai ana, <i>it is good</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_35"
id="page_35">{35}</a></span>This class is by far the most numerous.
Under it also may be comprised</p>

<p>(1) Verbs formed by reduplication; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Korerorero, <i>to hold conversation with, &amp;c.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>(2) <i>Compound</i> verbs, i.&nbsp;e. verbs formed from two or
more words joined together; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>Ma-te-matapihitia</i> mai, <i>give it me by the window</i>.</li>
  <li>Whaka-ngoi-koretia, <i>made weak</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;As the same
word is very frequently used in Maori as verb, substantive, adjective,
and adverb, it is often impossible to determine under which of the
above classes it should be ranked; neither, indeed, will it be
necessary; as the origin of the verb in no way affects its grammatical
relations.</p>

<p>§. 2. <span class="smcap">Number</span>, <span
class="smcap">Person</span>, and <span
class="smcap">Gender</span>.&mdash;Maori verbs are not declined by
inflection; i.&nbsp;e. by variation of the ground form; and therefore know
nothing of number, person, and gender.</p>

<p>§. 3. <span class="smcap">Mood</span> and <span
class="smcap">Tense</span>.&mdash;As neither the ground form, nor the
auxiliary particles experience any variation from change of mood, we
cannot recognize any grammatical form for denoting moods in Maori, and
shall not therefore enter any farther into the subject at present.</p>

<div class="small">
<p><span class="smcap">Note 1.</span>&mdash;The only variations we
have been able to discover are</p>

<p>1st. Those for denoting the imperative mood.</p>

<p>2nd. The prefixing of the particle waka to the verb, and thus
causing a Hiphil, or causative, conjugation. The prefixing of a
conjunction cannot, we think, warrant the creation of a distinct
form for the subjunctive mood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note 2.</span>&mdash;As the business of the
grammarian lies principally with the grammatical form of words, i.&nbsp;e.,
with those means with which a language is supplied for expressing the
different varieties of thought, it is clear that no form is to be
admitted under any head, which does not denote a meaning specifically
belonging to that head. Thus, in the case of the Maori moods, we
never, (as we sometimes do in English and other languages,) meet with
a variation in <i>form</i> from the root, either in the case of the
verb itself, or its auxiliaries; and we therefore consider that,
<i>grammatically</i> speaking, we have no form for these moods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36"
id="page_36">{36}</a></span>It is true, that in a <i>logical</i> point
of view, i.&nbsp;e., when the signification alone is considered, a great
many varieties both of mood and tense might be established. But this
can never be admitted as the basis on which a grammar should be
constructed; neither can any maxim be more true than that "equivalence
in sense does not imply similarity in grammatical nature."</p>
</div>

<p>§. 4. <span class="smcap">Tense.</span>&mdash;Maori abounds in a
variety of forms for denoting modifications of time. They are
designated by verbal particles, (vid. Note,) adverbs, prepositions,
pronouns, and the articles <i>he</i> and <i>te</i> placed in connexion
with the verb. The force of these, again, is, in a large majority of
cases, determined by the context, and we believe ourselves to be
correct in saying that there are, in this language, but few
<i>absolute</i> forms for determining <i>tense</i>; for example:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>E moe <i>ana</i>, <i>he is sleeping</i>.</li>
  <li>I reira <i>e</i> moe <i>ana</i>, <i>there was he sleeping</i>,
  or <i>there he slept</i>.</li>
  <li>I riri <i>au</i>, <i>I was angry</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Mo te aha</i> koe <i>i</i> riri mai ai ki a au? <i>why are
  you angry with me?</i></li>
  <li><i>Ka</i> haere ahau, <i>I will go</i>.</li>
  <li>Na <i>ka</i> whaka<i>tika</i> a Hone, <i>then John rose</i>.
  (See also preposition <i>mo</i>:)</li>
</ul>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The verbal
particles are words which have no meaning in themselves, but which
prefixed to a word, endue it with the qualities of a verb. They
correspond to the auxiliary verbs of English, but do not admit of the
same varieties of applications: neither can they lay claim to the rank
of verb substantive. Thus in Maori we have no <i>direct</i> form for
such phrases as the following, <i>I am</i>, <i>you will</i>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>§. 5. They are as follows: <i>e</i>, <i>ana</i>, <i>ha</i>,
<i>kua</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>kia</i>, <i>hei</i>, <i>me</i>, <i>kaua</i>,
<i>aua</i>, and <i>kei</i>.</p>

<p>Their uses will be best ascertained by examining the paradigm at the
end of this section. A more full consideration of them and of the
other modes of construction, which are therein contained, will be
deferred to the Syntax.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37"
id="page_37">{37}</a></span>As the voice of the verb but little
affects its conjugation, we have not thought it necessary to make any
separate head for the different voices; but have represented all in
the one table.</p>

<p>The student, however, is recommended to read our remarks on the
passive voice before he proceeds to examine into the tenses.</p>

<p>§. 6. It may be naturally expected that, in an unpolished language
like Maori, there should not be much that is artificial, or
complicated, in the arrangement of tenses. Such we believe to be the
case. It is true that some would contend for as many tenses as may be
found in English; but, independently of the improbability of such a
thing, we believe that a careful investigation will lead the inquirer
to the arrangement which we have adopted; viz. the <i>present</i>, the
<i>past</i>, and the <i>future</i>.</p>

<p>It is true that other tenses may sometimes be met with which are
accurately defined; but we cannot admit them a distinct place in the
modifications of the simple verb; because such forms are always
compound, or depend, at least, for their meaning upon the
construction, and belong more properly to the syntax than to this part
of the grammar.</p>

<p>§ 7. In examining into the time of a verb, it will often be very
necessary for the student to notice whether the sentence, in which it
is contained, is <i>simple</i>, or <i>compound</i>; a <i>simple</i>
sentence<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_12" id="R_12"
href="#F_12">[12]</a></span> is that which consists of only one time;
e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38"
  id="page_38">{38}</a></span><i>E</i> pai <i>ana</i>, <i>it is
  good</i>.</li>
  <li>Kahore ahau <i>i</i> kite, <i>I did not see (it)</i>.</li>
  <li>Ko tatou katoa, ano he hipi, <i>kua</i> marara ke, <i>we all as
  sheep have gone astray</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Kua</i> mate to tatou Kai whakaora i runga i te te ripeka,
  <i>our Saviour died upon the cross</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <i>compound</i> sentence is that in which two times
are introduced; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Me i reira ahau e pai ana, <i>if I had</i> been <i>there it
  would</i> have <i>been well</i>.</li>
  <li>Akuanei, tae rawa atu, kua mate, <i>it will come to pass, that,
  when I</i> have got <i>there</i>, he will <i>be dead</i>.</li>
  <li>Kua mate ahau, e ora ana nga rakau nei, <i>I shall die before
  these sticks decay</i>.</li>
  <li>Me i whakararatatia i mua, <i>kua</i> rarata, tenei, <i>if it
  had been tamed before, it</i> would have <i>been tame now</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of this, however, more hereafter.</p>

<p>We may here also mention that it will often be very necessary to
notice the circumstances connected with the uttering of a sentence, i.&nbsp;e.
whether it be emphatic; whether it be the answer to a question;
whether a large measure of certainty is designed to be implied,
&amp;c., &amp;c. On these particulars we shall remark in the
Syntax.</p>

<p class="small">.As it is quite immaterial with which part of the
verb we commence, we begin with the imperative; simply because our
remarks on it will be rather extended, and 2ndly, because we wish that
our illustrations of that mood should appear in an unbroken line with
our examples of the other parts of the Maori verbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39"
id="page_39">{39}</a></span>§. 8. The imperative mood of Maori abounds
in more minute distinctions than any other part of the verb. We
present them all here; chiefly because the sentences in which they
occur are, for the most part, <i>simple</i>.</p>

<p>1. The most common form for expressing the <i>imperative</i>
of an active verb is by its <i>passive</i>; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>

<table class="tbl" summary="active-imperative">
 <tr class="center">
  <td class="small">ACTIVE FORM.</td>
  <td class="small">IMPERATIVE.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Patu, <i>to strike</i>,</td>
  <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Patua, <i>strike (it)</i>.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Tua, <i>to fell</i>,</td>
  <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuaina, <i>fell (it)</i>.</td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>For the passive voice, see table under that head.</p>

<p>2. (a) If the verb be neuter, and in the second person, the simple
ground form is used; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Haere, <i>go</i>.</li>
  <li>Hororo, <i>make haste</i>.</li>
  <li>Tena, <i>be prompt, be quick</i>.</li>
  <li>Kati, <i>be quiet</i>.</li>
  <li>Whetero, <i>put out your tongue</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_13" id="R_13" href="#F_13">[13]</a></span></li>
</ul>

<p>(b) Occasionally, however, we find the passive form used, when the
meaning of the verb is neuter; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Hapainga, <i>let us start</i>.</li>
  <li>Takiritia, <i>idem</i>.</li>
  <li>Kokiritia, <i>dash forward</i> (in pursuit, &amp;c.)</li>
  <li>Hoea tatou, <i>let us paddle</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes both active and neuter verbs will take the verbal
prefixes <i>e</i>, <i>kia</i>, <i>hei</i>, <i>me</i>, <i>kaua</i>,
<i>aua</i>, <i>kei</i>, before them to denote the imperative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40"
id="page_40">{40}</a></span>(c) <i>E</i> is used sometimes to denote
the imperative of active and neuter verbs. It is chiefly used with the
second person singular, dual, and plural.</p>

<p>It is never found in the first person singular; but
is occasionally used in the first person dual and plural.
We know of no instance in which it is employed in
the third person, and we believe the following sentence
to be incorrect: E aroha mai te Atua ki a tatou, <i>may
God love us</i>.</p>

<p class="small">N.B.&mdash;Illustrations of these remarks will be
given in the table.</p>

<p>(d) <i>Kia</i> is capable of being used in all the persons of the
imperative. It is the particle most frequently used with the first
person. In the second, it is chiefly used with verbalized adjectives;
though occasionally it is prefixed to the verb. In the third, it is
used before either adjective or verb, and by its help we may, perhaps,
make the best approximation to a form of the imperative in which Maori
has been heretofore deficient; viz.&mdash;the benedictory; as in such
sentences as the following: <i>God be merciful to you</i>.</p>

<p class="small">N.B.&mdash;Another way for rendering the above
sentence (and one equally deserving of attention) is by the
preposition <i>ma</i>; as in the following; ma te atua koe e
atawhai.</p>

<p class="small">We ourselves much incline to a form which, at first
sight, may not appear very appropriate; viz., kei te atua te atawhai,
or tera kei te atua, &amp;c. Though these forms are apparently
<i>indicative</i>, yet they are frequently used in the
<i>imperative</i> sense; Kei a koe te whakaaro mo tena <i>the
consideration for that is with you</i>, i.&nbsp;e., <i>you are to
attend to that</i>; kei a koe te tahi kupu ki a tatou, <i>a word to us
is with you</i>, i.&nbsp;e., <i>give us a word</i>. Tena ano tetahi
taro i a koe ma taku tamaiti, <i>give me some bread for my child</i>.
E kite koe i a Hone tena te tahi paraikete, <i>if you see John, give
me a blanket</i>, i.&nbsp;e., <i>tell John to &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The dehortative and cautionary particles <i>kaua</i>, <i>aua</i>,
<i>kei</i>, belong strictly to the imperative.</p>

<p>(e) Under this head we should perhaps also mention the particle
<i>me</i>. As it is occasionally heard instead of the real imperative,
we shall give it a place here. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41"
id="page_41">{41}</a></span>It will be observed that it does not take
the passive after it; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Me patu te te poaka,</li>
  <li>Me hanga te taiepa.</li>
</ul>

<p>(f) The only particles the imperative of passive verbs will admit
before it are, <i>kia</i>, <i>kaua</i>, <i>aua</i>, and <i>kei</i>.
Following is a table of sentences illustrative of the above remarks.
We have preferred placing them all in one list that the student may
more easily catch the various distinctions. Other forms are given by
which the imperative is sometimes denoted.</p>

<p>§. 6. <span class="smcap">Voice.</span>&mdash;Maori verbs, in
respect of voice, may be considered under the three well known heads
of <i>active</i>, <i>passive</i> and <i>neuter</i>.</p>

<p>§. 7. The <i>active</i> is the simple root modified by one
or more of the words already mentioned, e.&nbsp;g. e patu
ana ahau, <i>I am striking</i>.</p>

<p>§. 8. The <i>passive</i> is the root varied in its termination;
e.&nbsp;g. e patua ana ahau, <i>I am struck</i>.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The student
will find, as we proceed, that the Maori passive differs in some
respects from that of the English, Latin and Greek.</p>

<p>§. 9. The <i>neuter</i> expresses being, or a state or condition of
being; when the agent and the object acted upon coincide, and the
event is properly neither <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_45"
id="page_45">{45}</a></span>action nor passion, but rather something
between both: as <i>I am</i>, <i>I sleep</i>, <i>I walk</i>."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_14" id="R_14"
href="#F_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<div class="small">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Verbs derived from the
simple adjective will generally rank under the head of neuter. Under
this class also do we reduce a species of verbs in the arrangement of
which we have felt some difficulty; viz.&mdash;such words as, pakaru,
<i>broken</i>; marere, <i>conceded</i>, &amp;c., <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
words which are neuter in form, but passive in meaning; which
correspond in meaning to the past participle passive of the European
languages, but are not traceable to any root. After much consideration
we are inclined to think that they may most satisfactorily be regarded
as adjectives, and classified accordingly: thus, in the following
sentence, "kua pakaru te waka i te ngaru," <i>the canoe has been
broken by the waves</i>, we should regard <i>pakaru</i> as an
adjective, or rather a verbalized adjective, just as much as we should
kino in the following, "kua <i>kino</i> te waka i te paru," <i>the
canoe is bad, or uncomfortable, through the filth</i>.</p>

<p>To any who wishes to regard such a class as passive participles, we
would reply, that the preposition <i>i</i>, (not <i>e</i>,) following
them clearly determines them as belonging to the neuter family; and
that though their meaning may not coincide with our definition of a
neuter verb, yet we feel no difficulty on that head; for we only act
in common with other grammarians, who have laid it down as a useful
rule "<i>a potiori nomen fit</i>."</p>

<p>As it may be useful to the student to be acquainted with this class
of words we will supply a table of some of the principal, after we
have made some farther observations on the voices.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_15" id="R_15"
href="#F_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>In the passive we meet with variation in the termination
of the ground-form.</p>

<p>(a) It will be seen that the above arrangement is
made according to the final letter of the ground form,
and that each division contains some examples of reduplicated
words, and of words ending in diphthongs.</p>

<p>(b) That, in words ending in <i>a</i>, the passive is
mostly made by adding to the last syllable <i>ia</i>, <i>ngia</i>,
<i>kia</i>, <i>hia</i>, <i>ina</i>, <i>atia</i>, <i>kina</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48"
id="page_48">{48}</a></span>(c) That some verbs receive no additions
to the last syllable; as <i>maka</i>, and that the active and passive
are, in those cases, alike. On the Eastern coast <i>ia</i> takes the
place of simple <i>a</i> in the passive; e.&nbsp;g. maka, makaia.</p>

<p class="small">The speaker should be always careful, in pronouncing
passive <i>a</i> to throw the emphasis strongly on the last syllable.
The following words are of this description: panga, <i>to throw
away</i>; pana, <i>to shove away, &amp;c.</i>; kanga, <i>to curse</i>;
wakamana, <i>to ratify, &amp;c.</i>; taunaha, <i>to bespeak</i>; taka,
<i>to fall from a height</i>; unga, <i>to send</i>; waha, <i>to carry
on the back</i>.</p>

<p>(d) That some verbs have sometimes two or more
terminations for the passive; as arohatia, arohaina,
arohangia. We may here remark that some words
have different passives in different districts; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Whangainga (Ngapuhi), Whangaia (Waikato.)</li>
</ul>

<p>(e) That in words, one or more of the syllables of
which are repeated, the reduplication will very frequently
be dropped in the passive; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Kikini, kinitia; tapatapahi tapahia, &amp;c.</li>
</ul>

<div class="small">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;It must however be noticed
that there are many exceptions to this rule, and that the omitting or
retaining the reduplication is often left to the option of the
speaker. In those instances, however, in which he wishes to denote
with peculiar emphasis the <i>distribution</i>, <i>repetition</i>,
&amp;c., implied by the reduplication, he always, as far as he can,
retains it; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Titititia, <i>strike every one of the nails</i>.</li>
  <li>Patupatua, <i>strike with many blows</i>, &amp;c.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>(f) In a few instances we meet with a passive
formed by a change of the first syllable; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Rongo, <i>to hear</i>; rangona (<i>passive</i>); wakarongo,
    wakarangona (<i>passive</i>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of this rule are very few.</p>

<p>(g) Of the passives of compound verbs, two examples
are given at the end of the table. The rule for
their formation is the same as that for the passives of
simple verbs: the final letters, in both cases, being the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49"
id="page_49">{49}</a></span>only thing on which they depend.
Occasionally, however, we meet with a word resolved into two parts,
and each part put into the passive voice; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Kaihau, (v. act.) <i>to sell the property of an individual
  without giving him any part of the payment</i>,
  Kai<i>nga</i>-hau<i>tia</i>, (passive).</li>
</ul>

<p>There is another form similar to the preceding, which requires to
be mentioned here; viz., when two verbs follow each other in immediate
succession, one of which acts as a kind of adverb, or qualifying word,
to the other, they will both sympathize with each other in voice; will
either be both active or both passive; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Toia haeretia, <i>dragged along</i>; lit. <i>dragged gone</i>.</li>
  <li>Tukua whakareretia, <i>let down with a dash</i>.</li>
  <li>Kai moe, <i>eat sleeping</i>, i.&nbsp;e., <i>while he is eating he is
    sleeping</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In such phrases the latter of the two verbs will generally take
<i>tia</i> for its passive form.</p>

<p>(h) Occasionally a passive word may be met with which has no
active; as <i>parangia</i> e te moe, <i>oppressed by sleep</i>;
<i>rokohina</i> and <i>rokohanga</i>, <i>waiho</i>, <i>homai</i> and
<i>hoatu</i>.</p>

<p>(i) Passive verbs are used in a more extended
sense in Maori, than what is commonly met with in
other languages, not excepting, perhaps, even the three
passives of Hebrew. </p>

<p>The following are a few illustrations of the various
uses:&mdash;</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Haere, <i>to go</i>, v.n., te huarahi i <i>haerea e ia</i>, <i>the
    road by which he travelled</i>.</li>
  <li>Neke, <i>move away (yourself)</i> v.n., nekehia atu, imp. <i>move
    (the thing) away</i>, kua nekehia, <i>was moved away</i>.</li>
  <li>Titore, <i>diffissus</i>, part. adj., Titorehia, imp.,

<p>Sometimes where it is desirable to make a distinction, on account of
the greatness of the difference between the two branches of the same

<p>§. 15. That we are correct in denominating such words, as the above,
"participial adjectives," will appear from the consideration that they
will assume the form of an adjective, or participle, according to the
nature of the word by which they may be translated: thus <i>marie</i>
may be translated <i>quiet</i>, and be considered an adjective; or
<i>pacified</i>, and be considered a participle. Neither indeed will
it appear strange that an adjective should be found, in one language,
exactly corresponding to a participle in another, if we only reflect
on the origin of the following  adjectives of the English;
<i>exact</i>, <i>competent</i>, <i>complete</i>, <i>perfect</i>,
<i>correspondent</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Like adjectives, these words will assume the form of a verb, when in
connexion with the verbal participles. Indeed, (as we have already
observed,) our impression is, that, the more we examine, the more
shall we be led to think that a genuine verb is by no means a common
thing in Maori; and that substantives, adjectives, and other classes,
are the fountains to which most of the verbs of the language may be
traced.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_11" id="F_11" href="#R_11">[11]</a>&#8195;
There are many things connected with this subject that will, no doubt,
often appear strange to the European reader; and he will frequently
have to be careful lest he be misled by theories derived from
occidental grammars. In those languages the verb is a leading word in
the sentence, and by it exclusively is the office of affirmation or
predication performed.</p>

<p class="nodent">In Maori, on the contrary, a pure genuine verb is by
no means of frequent occurrence: almost any word denoting a thing, or
quality, is capable of sustaining that office; and predication is as
frequently implied as expressed. In considering, therefore, the Maori
verbs, we shall have to examine, not only those words which have been
invested with the properties belonging to that class; but also those
forms in which no mark of predication is expressed. The term
predication we have adopted, for want of better, to denote those
functions which are peculiar to the verb, and which are sometimes
described by grammarians under the terms "affirmation" and
"assertion."</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_12" id="F_12" href="#R_12">[12]</a>&#8195;
We have adopted the term "sentence" in preference to "proposition,"
lest the student should be led into perplexity by conceiving that we
used the terms <i>simple</i> and <i>compound</i> in the same senses as
those in which they are used by logicians.</p>

<p class="nodent">From our examples he will see that we should call a
sentence simple, even though the subject and predicate be complex
terms.</p>

<p class="nodent">By noticing whether, when the sentence is
translated, one or two verbs are introduced, and whether either of
them is dependent in time on the other, the student will easily make
the distinction that we are desirous of establishing. The importance
of this distinction will be seen in our examples of a compound
sentence. For, in the first <i>e-ana</i>, which is present in a simple
sentence, is now past; in the second, <i>kua</i> is future, though it
strictly belongs to the past tense; in the fourth example this same
particle stands for the pluperfect potential.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_13" id="F_13" href="#R_13">[13]</a>&#8195;
We may here mention that, in speaking of actions done by members of
the body, Maori never supposes the individual, but rather the member,
to perform the act. Thus, such expressions as "lift up your head,"
"open your mouth," "stretch out your leg," would not be rendered, as
we have heard some speakers express it, by "huaia ake to matenga,"
"hamamatia to waha, &amp;c.," but rather "kia ara ake to matenga,"
"hamama tou waha," "wharoro tou waewae."</p>

<p class="nodent">We have, indeed, occasionally heard a native say,
wheterongia, (whaterongia, Ngapuhi) tou arero, titahangia; but these
phrases are very rare.</p>

N.B.&mdash;When we have occasion to speak of this class of
words by themselves, as distinct from neuter verbs, we shall
denominate them <i>participial adjectives</i>.</p>

<h2><span class="fs80">CHAPTER VIII.</span><br />OF THE PREPOSITIONS.</h2>

<p>Scarcely any part of Maori is more worthy of attention than the
prepositions. In no language, that we are acquainted with, are their
powers so extensive. While, in common with those of English and
Hebrew, they serve to express those relations, which in some languages
are chiefly marked by the different endings of the nouns, they extend
their influence still farther, and are, in many instances, of material
importance in determining the time of the sentence in which they are
placed.</p>

<p>They are simple and compound. The simple are those which, in
construction, take no other preposition into union with them. The
principal prepositions of this class are as follows:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>E, <i>by</i>.</li>
  <li>I, <i>by, with, from, to, through, in, at, than</i>.</li>
  <li>Ki, <i>with, to, for, at, according to, in</i>.</li>
  <li>Kei, <i>at</i>.</li>
  <li>No, <i>of, from</i>.</li>
  <li>Na, <i>of, by, through</i>.</li>
  <li>Mo, <i>for</i> (or <i>because of</i>), <i>for</i> (possession),
    <i>at</i> &amp;c., &amp;c.</li>
  <li>Ma, <i>for, by, concerning</i>.</li>
  <li>Hei, <i>at, for</i>.</li>
  <li>O, <i>of</i>.</li>
  <li>A, <i>at</i>.</li>
  <li><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_56"
  id="page_56">{56}</a></span>Ko, <i>at</i>.</li>
  <li>To, <i>up to</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The compound prepositions are those which, like
the <i>composite</i> of Hebrew, require one or more of the
simple to set forth their meaning. They are as
follows:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Runga, <i>upon or above</i>.</li>
  <li>Raro, <i>beneath</i>.</li>
  <li>Mua, <i>before</i>.</li>
  <li>Muri, <i>behind</i>.</li>
  <li>Roto, or ro, <i>inside</i>.</li>
  <li>Waho, <i>outside</i>.</li>
  <li>Tua, <i>other side</i>.</li>
  <li>Pahaki, <i>other side, or this side of</i>, (used in describing the
    position of an object.)</li>
  <li>Tai, idem.</li>
  <li>Waenga, <i>midst of</i>.</li>
  <li>Tata, <i>near</i>.</li>
  <li>Tawhiti, <i>far off</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The meaning and uses, however, of the above, both <i>simple</i>,
and <i>compound</i>, are exceedingly various; and the attention of the
student is therefore requested to the following notices respecting
them.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_16" id="R_16"
href="#F_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>E, <i>by</i> (applied to the <i>agent</i>, not the <i>instrument</i>)
is always prefixed to the agent when a passive verb precedes; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Kua kainga <i>e</i> te kuri, <i>was devoured by the dog</i>.</li>
  <li>Kua kitea <i>e</i> Hone, <i>was seen by John</i>.</li>
  <li>Kua patua te ngaru <i>e</i> te ua, <i>the waves were beaten down by
    the rain</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When neuter<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_17" id="R_17"
href="#F_17">[17]</a></span> verbs assume the passive form the agent
follows, as in regular transitive verbs, and is <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_57" id="page_57">{57}</a></span>preceded by <i>e</i>; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Katahi ano a kona ka takotoria <i>e</i> te tupeka, <i>now for the
    first time has that place been laid upon by tobacco</i>&mdash;now for
    the first time has tobacco lain there.</li>
  <li>Kangia <i>e</i> te ahi, <i>kindled upon by the fire</i>, i.&nbsp;e.
    having a fire kindled (there).</li>
</ul>

<p>Verbal nouns, and verbs preceded by such words as <i>hohoro</i>,
<i>oti</i>, <i>ahei</i>, <i>hei</i>, <i>pau</i>, <i>taea</i>,
<i>taihoa</i>, <i>taria</i>, &amp;c., will take <i>e</i> after them;
e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Ngaunga <i>e</i> te ra, <i>a scorching by the sun</i>.</li>
  <li>Kua <i>oti</i> te patu <i>e</i> au, <i>the killing has been finished
    by me</i>; i.&nbsp;e. I have killed (it).</li>
  <li>E kore e <i>ahei</i> te hapai <i>e</i> ahau, <i>the lifting cannot
    be accomplished by me</i>, i.&nbsp;e., I cannot lift (it).</li>
</ul>

<p>The following, also, are instances in which <i>e</i> is
found after the active verb&mdash;after a verb, at least,
active in <i>form</i>.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>Me</i> wero <i>e</i> koe, <i>you must stab it</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Me</i> wewete <i>e</i> ia, <i>he must let it go</i>.</li>
  <li>He <i>mea hanga</i> e to ringaringa, <i>a thing made by the hand</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Ka te</i> arai mai i taku ahi <i>e</i> koe, (a Waikatocism),
    <i>(see!) you exclude the fire from me</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I, <span class="smcap">by</span>, (follows a neuter verb, no matter
whether the agent be animate or inanimate):</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Kua mate i a Hone, <i>killed by John</i>.</li>
  <li>Pakaru i te hau, <i>broken by the wind</i>.</li>
  <li>Ka mate ahau i te wai, <i>I am dead by water</i>, i.&nbsp;e., I
  am thirsty.</li>
</ul>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">With</span>.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Kia haere atu ahau i a koe? <i>Shall I go with you?</i></li>
  <li>Ka riro mai i a au, <i>will depart with me</i>, i.&nbsp;e., I
  shall take, or obtain it.</li>
</ul>

<div class="small">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;In this latter sentence
foreigners often make mistakes, and render it, ka riro mai <i>ki</i> a
au. Wherever <i>obtaining</i>, <i>receiving</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_58" id="page_58">{58}</a></span><i>taking</i>, for possession,
or such like, is intended, <i>i</i> mostly signifies the <i>person</i>,
<i>ki</i> the <i>place</i>; as in the following examples:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Ka riro to kotiro <i>i</i> te Kainga maori, <i>your servant girl
    will be taken away by (the people) of the native place</i>.</li>
  <li>Ka riro to kotiro <i>ki</i> te kainga maori, <i>your servant girl
    will go to the native place</i>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>If the following passage were properly and correctly translated, how
different would its meaning be from that intended by the speaker! kia
riro atu ratou i te hunga nanakia, <i>rescue them out from the cruel
people</i>. The true meaning of the passage, as it stands, is, <i>Let
them depart into the power of the cruel</i>.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">From</span>,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>I</i>hea koe? <i>From whence do you (come)?</i></li>
  <li>Ki tetahi rongoa <i>i</i> a Hone, <i>for some medicine from
  John</i>.</li>
  <li>Inoia he ngakau hou <i>i</i> a Ia, <i>pray for a new heart from
  him</i>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="small">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;For the difference between
<i>i</i> and <i>no</i> see the latter proposition § 4. Under this head
may be mentioned a <i>partitive sense</i> in which <i>i</i> is
sometimes taken; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Tangohia <i>i</i> &#257; Hone, <i>take some of John's</i>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">To</span>, (denoting possession, used
somewhat similarly to the dative we find in Latin when <i>sum</i> is
used for <i>habeo</i>;) e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">

  <li>Kahore he maripi i a au, <i>there is no knife to me; I have no

adjectives),</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>E rangi tenei <i>i</i> tena, <i>this is better than that</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>10. Under this head may be classed some instances
that cannot well be reduced to any of the above rules:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>E hara koe <i>i</i> te rangatira noku, <i>you are not my master</i>.
  E hara <i>i</i> a koe, (a kind of jocose phrase corresponding,
    perhaps, to that of some in England, <i>you are a pretty
    fellow</i>.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The following examples seem to be opposed to rule 1, and are therefore
deserving of notice. They are perhaps confined to Waikato:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Ka timu te tai <i>i</i> a tatou, <i>the tide for us (to pull with)
    will ebb</i>.</li>
  <li>Haere mai ki te wahi ruru <i>i</i> a koe, <i>come to the spot
    sheltered for you</i>.</li>
  <li>Kei to moe <i>i</i> ona karu, <i>he is indulging his eyes with
    sleep</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In such instances as these, we should regard <i>i</i> as pleonastic,
somewhat like, perhaps, the prepositions <i>from</i> and <i>in</i> of
Hebrew and Arabic.</p>

<p>The student should ever be mindful of the distinction between the
preposition <i>i</i> and the particle by which the accusative, (as it
would be called in Latin,) <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_60"
id="page_60">{60}</a></span>is denoted. This particle has, of itself,
no specific meaning. In many instances its use is similar to that of
<i>êhth</i> in Hebrew; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>A ka kite te Atua <i>i</i> te maramatanga, <i>and God saw the
    light</i>, Gen. i. 4.</li>
  <li>Kua whakarere ratou <i>i</i> a Ihowa, <i>they have forsaken</i>
    <span class="smcap">Jehovah</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>It follows an active verb, whereas the preposition follows the neuter,
and signifies <i>by</i>. The uses of the two words are totally
opposite, as may be seen in the following example. A young teacher
wishing to say, <i>sin produces pain</i>, thus expressed his
sentiment: Ko te kino ka whanau i te mamae. Now, whanau is not an
active verb. It is a participial adjective. It is used correctly in
John iii. 8, Whanau i te Wairua, <i>born of the Spirit</i>. The
sentence therefore that we have adduced, if strictly translated, would
run thus, <i>sin is born of, or produced by pain</i>.</p>

<p>KI, <span class="smcap">with</span>, (denotes the instrument);
e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Patua <i>ki</i> te rakau, <i>beaten with a stick</i>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="small">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;When used in this sense it
very rarely follows neuter verbs; for example it would not be correct
to say, Ka <i>wera</i> i a au <i>ki</i> te ahi, <i>it will be burned
up by me with fire</i>. Some passive verb, as <i>tahuna</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> should, in this case precede instead of <i>wera</i>.
The following form, however, is correct:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>E kore e ora <i>ki</i> tena, <i>will not be satisfied with that
    quantity (of food)</i>.</li>
  <li>E kore e oti <i>ki</i> tena, <i>will not be completed</i> with
    <i>that</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many speakers confound the instrumental character (if we may so
speak) of this preposition with another use of the word <i>with</i>,
which, we believe, is seldom denoted by <i>ki</i>.</p>

<p>If, for example, we had to translate into Latin the following
sentence, "to speak with fear;" (i.&nbsp;e. timidly,) how incorrect would
it be to render <i>fear</i> into the ablative that is used for
denoting an instrument! All would see that <i>dicere metu</i> does
not express that meaning, and that <i>cum metu dicere</i>, or
something to that effect, was the true rendering. So also here,
wherever <i>appendage</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61"
id="page_61">{61}</a></span><i>connexion</i> and such like is
intended, <i>ki</i> is, we believe, a preposition that is very seldom
called into use. We therefore disapprove of such a sentence as the
following:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Inoi atu <i>ki</i> te ngakau aroha, <i>pray with a loving heart</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>It should however be noticed that <i>ki</i> is sometimes found in
other uses of the word <i>with</i>, in which no instrumentality is
designed; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Taku mahinga ki a koe, <i>my working with you</i>; i.&nbsp;e., my work in
    your service.</li>
  <li>E riri ana ki a koe, <i>is angry with you</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This last example, however, might perhaps be most correctly
translated <i>at</i>; as in the following:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>E titiro mai ana ki a koe, <i>is looking at you</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>On this use of <i>ki</i> we shall have to remark in the Syntax.</p>
</div>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">To</span>,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Ho mai ki a au, <i>give it to me</i>.</li>
  <li>Haere <i>ki</i> Manukau, <i>go to Manukau</i>.</li>
  <li>Te rohe <i>ki</i> a koe, <i>the boundary to you</i>; i.&nbsp;e.,

</ul>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">For</span>,</p>

</ul>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">According to</span>,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>E ai <i>ki</i> tana, <i>according to what he says</i>; i.&nbsp;e., as he
    would have it, &amp;c.</li>
  <li><i>Ki</i> ta ratou, <i>ki</i> taua taro na, he kikokiko,
    <i>according to them, as concerning that bread, it is flesh</i>;
    i.&nbsp;e., they maintain that that bread is flesh.</li>
</ul>

<p class="small"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62"
id="page_62">{62}</a></span>We would here suggest by way of corollary
that in quoting the sentiments of any writer, the most appropriate
form for the phrase "<i>according to</i>" would be <i>ki ta</i>, as in
the above example. Thus <i>the gospel according to St. Matthew</i>
might be well rendered by "ko te rongo pai <i>ki ta</i> Matiu;" <i>the
rule, according to my opinion</i>, <i>is</i>, &amp;c., "ko te tikanga,
ki taku whakaaro, ko &amp;c."</p>

<p>It is used also where <i>if</i> would be employed in English:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>Ki</i> te haere ahau, <i>If I go</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes (in Waikato) it is used pleonastically:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Kahore <i>ki te</i> matara to haere mai, <i>it was not such a
    distance but he might have come</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Frequently, in consequence of the elliptical character
of the language, it is found in various other uses,
which it is difficult to reduce to rule. The following
are a few examples:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>E noho ana koe <i>ki te</i> kai mau? <i>are you staying</i> from
    <i>food?</i></li>
  <li>Te tatau <i>ki</i> a au, <i>the door to me</i>; i.&nbsp;e., open the door
    for or to me.</li>
  <li>Ka riro te waka <i>ki</i> a koe, <i>the canoe for you will be
    gone</i>; i.&nbsp;e., the canoe that is to take you will, &amp;c.</li>
  <li>Heoi ano <i>ki</i> a tame ko te whare, <i>let the tent be the only
    thing</i> for <i>the bull (to carry)</i>.</li>
  <li>Taria e hoe <i>ki</i> a au, <i>delay your pulling (or paddling) for
    me</i>; i.&nbsp;e., wait for me.</li>
  <li>Tikina atu tetahi kete, <i>ki te</i> kete nui, <i>ki te</i> kete
    hou, <i>fetch a basket</i>, let it <i>be a large basket</i>, let
    it <i>be a new basket</i>.</li>
  <li>I riri ahau ki reira, <i>thereupon, or at that thing, was I
    angry</i>.</li>
  <li>I haere mai ahau <i>ki a</i> koe <i>ki te</i> waka <i>ki a</i> au,
    <i>I have come to you</i> for the <i>canoe</i> for me; i.&nbsp;e., to
    get a loan of your canoe.</li>
</ul>

<p class="small">From the above sentence the student will form an idea
of how much the business of language is performed in Maori by
prepositions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_63"
id="page_63">{63}</a></span>KEI, <span
class="smcap">at</span>.&mdash;It denotes chiefly present time;
e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>Kei</i>hea? <i>Kei</i> te kainga. <i>Where is it? At the
    settlement.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">At.</span> (future time.) It is not
unfrequently found in such constructions as the following:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>Kei</i> te mane ka haere mai, <i>on Monday he will come here</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>3. Sometimes, in animated language, it is used instead
of <i>ko</i> before the nominative case; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>Kei</i> te ringaringa o Ngakete, aroarohaki kau ana, <i>the hand
    of Ngakete, it was all a quiver</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>4. Occasionally, in Waikato, it is used in the following construction:
kua riro <i>kei</i> te hoe mai, <i>he is gone to fetch it (the
canoe)</i>. We are aware that it has been said that there should be a
stop at <i>riro</i>, and that properly the above may be said to
consist of two sentences, as follows: <i>he is gone, he is fetching
it</i>. We are, however, certain that many sentences will be heard, in
which no stop can be detected in the native pronunciation.</p>

<p>5. Sometimes it is used in the sense of <i>like</i>:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>Kei</i> te ahi e toro, <i>like fire that burns</i>.</li>
  <li>Koia ano <i>kei</i> te kowhatu, <i>exactly as if it were a stone</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>NO, <span class="smcap">of</span>, (the sign of the possessive
case.) In this signification <i>he</i> is the only article that it
will admit before it; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>He wanaunga <i>no</i> Hone, <i>a relation of John's</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following construction, however, is an exception:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Katahi ano te potae pai <i>no</i> Hone, <i>for the first time the
    good hat of John's</i>, i.&nbsp;e., <i>what an excellent hat is that of
    John's!</i></li>
</ul>

<div class="small">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;We may here observe that, in
denoting the possessive case, <i>no</i> follows <i>he</i>, and
<i>o</i> follows <i>te</i>, or nga. The following sentence is
incorrect:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Ano he tamariki <i>o</i> te Atua, <i>as children of God</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_64"
id="page_64">{64}</a></span>The <i>he</i> here requires <i>no</i>
after it. We shall have occasion hereafter (vid. verbs Syntax) to
mention an exception to this rule which is sometimes heard among the
tribes to the southward of Waikato.</p>
</div>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">From</span>, (that time),</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>No</i> te mane i haere mai ai, <i>he came here (last) Monday</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">From</span>, (that cause),</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>No</i> reira i kino ai, <i>from that cause was he displeased</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;In all
examples of this, and the preceding head, <i>no</i> will take a past
tense after it.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">From</span>, (that place),</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>No</i> Matamata tenei tangata, <i>this man belongs to
    Matamata</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="small">There is a distinction between this meaning of
<i>no</i>, and that of <i>i</i>, (vid. <i>i</i>. 3.) which is very
useful and important. <i>No</i> signifies the place to which you
belong, whether it be England, Rotorua, &amp;c. <i>I</i> signifies the
place you have been visiting as a mere sojourner.</p>

<p class="small">Thus if we were to ask a person, "<i>No</i> hea koe?"
he would most probably reply, "<i>No</i> Hauraki, <i>no</i> Waikato,"
or some place of which he was a denizen; but if we were to ask
"<i>I</i> hea koe?" he would then mention some place he had been just
visiting. This distinction does not seem to be so clearly recognized
at the northward as it is in all the central parts of the island.</p>

<p>NA, <span class="smcap">of</span>, the active form of <i>no</i>,
(vid. Syntax for the distinction between <i>o</i> and <i>a</i>).</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Na does not in
this sense take a passive after it. It is not quite certain that
<i>na</i> does, in such sentences as the above, signify <i>by</i>. The
subject will be more fully considered in the Syntax. (vid. verbs).</p>

<p class="small">Na, in this sense, always takes <i>i</i> after it.
The following sentence is incorrect: Nana hoki <i>kua</i> tohutohu

</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65"

<p>1. <span class="smcap">For</span> or <span class="smcap">BECAUSE
OF</span>, (followed most frequently by a past tense, even though the

<p>A very common way of denoting contingency is to associate <i>ma</i> or

direct meaning in the sentence. We give the following sentence in
full, that the reader may better understand our meaning.</p>

<i>use</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>, where in English we should use <i>as</i>,
<i>to</i>, <i>for</i>, <i>instead</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>, e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Haria etahi kanga <i>hei</i> o mou, <i>take some corn as viaticum
    for you</i>.
  <i>Hei</i> aha tena? hei rewa mo te poti; <i>what is that for? as a
    mast for the boat</i>.
  Kowai <i>hei</i> tiki? <i>who is to fetch (it)?</i></li>
</ul>

<div class="small">
<p>Sometimes we hear the following:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Aua <i>hei</i> pena: <i>do not so</i>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>3. Occasionally, but rarely, it is used to denote <i>frequent
action</i>; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Ko wai <i>hei</i> ruke tonu i nga riwai nei, <i>who is this that
    is</i> continually <i>throwing about the potatoes?</i></li>
</ul>

<div class="small">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;A very strange use of this
preposition is to be found in some parts of the south-eastern coast;
as in the following examples:&mdash;</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Haere koe hei rakau, <i>go fetch a stick</i>.
   Haere koe hei wai, <i>go fetch water</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the western coast such an address would be a most offensive curse.</p>
</div>

<p>O, <span class="smcap">of</span>; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Te whare <i>o</i> Hone, <i>the house of John</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A, <span class="smcap">of</span>; the active form of <i>o</i>; vid. S.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Te mahi <i>a</i> Hone, <i>John's work</i>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="small">
<p>N.B.&mdash;We sometimes meet with <i>to</i> and <i>ta</i>; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Ko <i>to</i> Hone ware, <i>John's house</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Such words however are clearly composed of <i>to</i> and <i>o</i>,
or <i>a</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>A. (This seems to be different from the article <i>a</i>,
as also from the foregoing.)</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><span class="smcap">At.</span>&mdash;<i>A</i> te mane,
      <i>on</i>, or <i>at, the Monday</i> (we will go,) &amp;c.</li>
</ul>

<p>KO. (This seems to be different from the verbal particle
<i>ko</i>;&mdash;vid. <i>verbal particles</i> Syntax.)</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><span class="smcap">At.</span>&mdash;<i>Ko</i> reira noho ai,
      <i>at that place stop</i>.<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ko</i> reira korero ai,
      <i>then speak</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69"
id="page_69">{69}</a></span>TO, <span class="smcap">up to</span>. The
following is the only construction in which we have heard this
preposition.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>To</i> nga hope te wai, <i>the water is up to the loins</i>.</li>
  <li>Ka <i>to</i> nga uma te wai nei, <i>the water is up to the
    breast</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="small">N.B.&mdash;<i>To</i> almost always takes a plural
number after it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Compound Prepositions.</span>&mdash;One or two
examples will be a sufficient illustration of all.</p>

<p><i>Runga</i> is capable of the following combinations: I runga i, ki
runga ki, ki runga i, ki runga o, no runga no, no runga i, o runga o,
kei runga kei, kei runga i, hei runga i, hei runga hei, mo runga mo,
&amp;c., &amp;c. The first preposition in the combination and the meaning of
the sentence will always determine the last.</p>

<p>Sometimes the adverbs <i>ake</i> and <i>iho</i>, (vid. adverbs,) as
also the particles <i>atu</i> and <i>mai</i>, are postfixed to the
prepositions to increase its force; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>E ngari tena i runga <i>ake</i>, <i>that which is above (it) is
    better</i>.</li>
  <li>A muri <i>ake</i> nei, <i>hereafter</i>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="small">
<p>A very singular use of <i>roto</i> (or <i>ro</i>) may be found in
the neighbourhood of the East Cape: e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Kei <i>ro</i> whare, <i>inside the house</i>.</li>
  <li>Kei <i>ro</i> pouaka, <i>in the box</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A similar use of <i>waenga</i> may be found in all parts of the
island; e.&nbsp;g.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Kei <i>waenga</i> riwai, <i>in the midst of the potatoe (field.)</i></li>
  <li>Kei <i>waenga</i> mara, <i>in the midst of the cultivation</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Its use however does not extend much beyond those instances.</p>
</div>

<p>A very common and elegant use of <i>runga</i> is, when it is employed
in the sense of <i>amongst</i>, <i>on</i>, or <i>with</i>, to denote
<i>concomitancy</i>, &amp;c., &amp;c.; as in the following examples:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>I hokona e koe i <i>runga</i> i te he, <i>you purchased it on a bad
    title</i>.</li>
  <li>Kei <i>runga</i> tenei i to mahi, <i>we are now on the work</i>;
    i.&nbsp;e., are busily engaged at work.</li>
  <li><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70"
  id="page_70">{70}</a></span>E karakia ana i <i>runga</i> i te he,
  <i>he worships on sin</i>; i.&nbsp;e. while he worships God he
  practices sin.</li>
</ul>

<div class="small">
<p>The preceding examples suggest a good approximation to a form of
expression which, we confess, we have been unable to find under the
preposition <i>ki</i>; i.&nbsp;e. <i>with</i> noting concomitancy,
(vid. <i>ki</i> (1)), as in the following examples: "Pray with faith;"
"love God with your whole heart." In these sentences we should have no
hesitation in using <i>runga</i>.</p>

<p>A very common form of, we believe, Maori origin, is,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Kia haere atu te inoi i <i>runga</i> i a te Karaiti, <i>let the
     prayer go forth upon Christ</i>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The other compound prepositions may often be rendered very useful by
giving them, as in the above, a figurative acceptation according with
the nature of the subject. One or two examples will suffice.</p>

<p><i>Tua</i> is thus employed:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>He tau ki tua, <i>a year is on the other side; this day year, what a
    long time</i> (you intend to be absent)!</li>
  <li>He mate kei tua, <i>misfortune is on the other side</i>, i.&nbsp;e.
    <i>awaits you</i>.</li>
  <li>Kei tua o te ra tapu nei, <i>next week</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The student should carefully remember that <i>muri</i> and <i>mua</i>
do not exactly correspond with <i>behind</i> and <i>before</i> in
English, and that <i>tua</i> is very frequently employed to denote
those words.</p>

<p>We have heard the following very erroneous expressions from some old
settlers:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Tutakina to tatau o te aroaro, <i>shut the door of the front</i>,
    i.&nbsp;e. the front door.</li>
  <li>Kei muri i te whare, <i>behind the house</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Muri</i> and <i>mua</i> (as well as the substantive <i>aroaro</i>)
are chiefly employed in connexion with living objects. When allusion
is made to the date of events, the student will remember that the
prepositions <i>a</i>, <i>mo</i>, <i>mo</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>hei</i>,
<i>kei</i>, <i>ko</i>, <i>hei a</i> and <i>ko a</i>, denote future
time, and that <i>no</i>, <i>i</i>, and <i>o</i> will always indicate
past time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_71"
id="page_71">{71}</a></span>These prepositions will sometimes take
verbal particles into connexion with them, and may be frequently found
in other forms to occupy the place of verbs, substantives, and
adverbs; vid. ch. 1, § 6. (c), ch. 7. § 1. (b), and ch. 9.</p>

<p>Sometimes we meet with other forms for denoting what would be
represented by a preposition in English. Though their proper place
belongs to the dictionary, we beg the reader's permission to insert a
few here:</p>

<table class="xmpl" summary="xmpl01">
  <tr>
   <td colspan="5">Puta noa i tera taha, <i>(make its appearance out
   at the other side)</i>;&mdash;<i>through</i>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>A taea noatia tenei ra,</td>
   <td class="tall3" rowspan="3">{</td>
   <td><i>arrives on to</i></td>
   <td class="tall3" rowspan="3">}</td>
   <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;or</td>
   <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;or</td>
   <td><i>this day</i>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>A tae noa ki tenei ra</td>
   <td><i>till it reaches</i></td>
   <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>A Mangapouri atu ana, <i>even to Mangapouri</i>.</li>
  <li>I te takiwa, <i>(in the interval);&mdash;between</i>.</li>
  <li>I te ritenga atu, <i>(in the line or direction
   of);&mdash;ante</i> and <i>contra&mdash;over against</i>.</li>
  <li>Ki tona aroaro, <i>(to his front);&mdash;before</i>.</li>
  <li>I tetahi taha ona i tetahi taha, <i>(on one side,
   on one side);&mdash;round about him</i>.</li>
  <li>Ki tera taha, <i>(to the other side);&mdash;across (a stream)</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The prefix <i>whaka</i>, when in union with a word,
will impart the meaning of <i>towards</i>, and change it
into an adverb; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Kumea whakarunga, <i>pull upwards</i>.</li>
  <li>Haere whaka tepa, <i>go towards the pa</i>.</li>
  <li>I hoatu ai e ahau <i>i whakaaro ki</i> tona matua, <i>I gave it to
    him in consideration of his father; (propter.)</i></li>
  <li>Kihai ahau i whakaae, i whakaaro hoki ki a Hone; <i>I did not assent
    on account of John</i>; i.&nbsp;e. <i>for John's sake</i>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="small">
<p>The above form deserves, we think, the notice of our Missionary
brethren as supplying a good approximation to an use <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_72" id="page_72">{72}</a></span>of
the word <i>by</i>, which we have not been able to find under the
preposition <i>ki</i> or <i>mo</i>, viz., when it is used in
<i>adjuration</i>. If, for example, we had to translate into prose the
following stanza:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockdent"><i>By</i> thy birth, and early years;<br />
  <i>By</i> thy griefs, and sighs, and tears;<br />
  Jesus look with pitying eye.<br />
  Hear, and spare us when we cry,</p>

<p class="nodent">we should feel very reluctant to use either
<i>ki</i> or <i>mo</i>. For, in that case, our Lord's hearing would be
represented as a thing <i>to be</i> accomplished, or purchased by
himself <i>with</i> his birth and early years&mdash;a version quite
foreign from the original.</p>

<p>We should therefore prefer something to this effect:&mdash;"Whakarongo
mai, tohungia hoki matou, &amp;c., wakamaharatia tou whanautanga, &amp;c.,"
or, "kia mahara hoki ki tou whanautanga ki tou taitamarikitanga, &amp;c.,
&amp;c."</p>

<p>Some, perhaps, would prefer&mdash;"I whanua nei hoki koe i taitamariki,
&amp;c.;" neither should we object to such a form. All we contend for is,
that <i>ki</i> and <i>mo</i> will not answer, and that they would
often, in such kind of sentences, convey very erroneous doctrines.
Approximation to such a meaning is all we can hope for; and that is
the best which differs least in <i>sense</i> from the original.</p>

subject placed thus, in one connected view before him.</p>

<h2><span class="fs80">CHAPTER IX.</span><br />OF THE ADVERBS.</h2>

<p>The adverbs of Maori may be considered under two
heads, <i>primitive</i> and <i>derivative</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>primitive</i> are but few in number.</p>

<p>The <i>derivative</i> are very numerous, and may be thus
ranked:</p>

<p>1st. Those which require some preposition to exhibit their
application; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>Ki</i> hea, <i>no</i> reira.</li>
</ul>

<p>2ndly. Those which are derived from words of other parts of speech.</p>

<p>3rdly. Those phrases which supply the place of adverbs.</p>

<p>The last class is very large, Maori being deficient in the variety of
adverbs; and though, strictly speaking, most of them cannot claim a
place in this chapter, we shall mention them:</p>

<p>1stly. Because many foreigners are much perplexed from not being
acquainted with them, and</p>

<p>2ndly. Because, being idiomatic phrases, a knowledge of them is of
great importance to the composition of elegant Maori.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note 1.</span>&mdash;Some of the
following adverbs might, it will be seen, have been easily classified
under other heads. It was necessary, however, to have a
classification, and it is not of much consequence under which head a
phrase of equivocal character should be classed.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_74"
id="page_74">{74}</a></span><span class="smcap">Note
2.</span>&mdash;Some of the adverbial particles are fully considered
in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Adverbs may be reduced to the following classes:&mdash;to those of
time, place, order, quantity, quality, manner, affirmation, negation,
comparison, interrogation, and intensity.</p>

<h3>OF INTERROGATION.</h3>

<p>Maori has many particles which indicate interrogation, and which

<i>num</i> of Latin; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">

  <li>Ine, (Waikato,) differs but little in its use from the above.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Ranei</i>, <i>ianei</i>, <i>iana</i>, and <i>iara</i>, are always
incorporated into the sentence, and generally denote a question, e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>E pai ana <i>ranei</i> koe?</li>
  <li>Koia?<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_26" id="R_26"

  <li>Oti, <i>else</i>.</li>
  <li>Na-te-aha? <i>why?</i></li>
  <li>Me pehea? How <i>must it be done?</i></li>
</ul>

<p><i>Ranei</i> is very frequently used in the sense of <i>whether</i>.</p>

in Waikato.</p>

<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>I hoki <i>rawa</i> mai koe ihea? <i>what is the exact, or last place

  <li>Pokuru <i>iho</i>, pokuru <i>iho</i> te namu, densely <i>clustered

<div class="small">
<p>Maori, as might be expected in the language of a rude people, abounds
in adverbs of intensity. We shall have to mention some of these
hereafter, (vid. adjective, comparative degree, Syntax.) They
sometimes elegantly supply the place of verbal particles, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86" id="page_86">{86}</a></span>we
shall have occasion to show when we treat on the Syntax of the verbs.</p>

<p>From the preceding table the student will see that Maori has the
power of increasing its adverbs to any extent, and that the chief
process by which a word may be converted into an adverb, is by
placing it in immediate connexion with the verb or adjective.</p>

<p>It should, perhaps, be here noticed, 1st, that Maori inclines to this
mode of construction. Thus, where we should say, <i>the women and the
children must all roll the log</i>; a native would most probably
employ the adverb; e.&nbsp;g., Huri <i>tane</i> huri <i>wahine</i>. Such a
mode of construction, though loose, is, however, concise and
emphatic.</p>

<p>2ndly. That the adverb, in this case, admits of the same variations
as the verb&mdash;admits of number, voice, and the form of the verbal
noun. For this, however, vid. Syntax.</p>

<p>3rdly. That another process for the creation of adverbs is by
prefixing <i>whaka</i>, or <i>a</i> to the preposition, noun, or
adverb.</p>

<p>4thly. That the compound prepositions, especially when <i>time</i>
and <i>place</i> are denoted, will very often take the adverbial
form.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_27" id="R_27"
href="#F_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>5thly and lastly. It would be a very useful exercise for the student
to examine those sentences, the place of which would be supplied by
an adverb in English, and notice the nature of their construction.
Some, for example, he will find rendered by the verb, some by the
verbal noun, some by the substantive in the possessive case, some by
the pronoun, &amp;c.</p>

These adverbs of time are arranged according to their
times, past present, and future. For the time of those adverbs which
are compounded with prepositions, vid. the simple prepositions,
chapter 8. The principal compound adverbs are <i>hea</i>, <i>ahea</i>,
<i>mua</i>, <i>muri</i>, <i>amata</i>, <i>apopo</i>, <i>reira</i>,
<i>ko</i>. They are chiefly adverbs of time and place. As they are of
very common use, we shall give examples of their various combinations.
Some of these combinations ought, perhaps, more properly to be
considered as belonging to the class of substantives:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>A</i> hea?</li>
  <li><i>Ko</i> hea?</li>
  <li><i>No</i> hea?</li>
  <li><i>Na</i> hea?</li>
  <li><i>I</i> hea?</li>
  <li><i>Mo</i> hea?</li>
  <li><i>Ma</i> hea?</li>
  <li><i>Ki</i> hea?</li>
  <li><i>Kei</i> hea?</li>
  <li><i>I</i> hea?</li>
  <li><i>O</i> hea?</li>
  <li><i>Hei</i> hea?</li>
  <li><i>A</i> popo.</li>
  <li><i>Ko</i> apopo.</li>
  <li><i>Mo</i> apopo.</li>
  <li><i>Hei</i> apopo.</li>
  <li><i>A</i> mua.</li>
  <li><i>Ko</i> amua.</li>
  <li><i>Ko</i> mua.</li>
  <li><i>No</i> mua.</li>
  <li><i>Na</i> mua.</li>
  <li><i>I</i> mua.</li>
  <li><i>Mo</i> mua.</li>
  <li><i>Mo</i> a mua.</li>
  <li><i>Ma</i> mua.</li>
  <li><i>Ki</i> mua.</li>
  <li><i>Kei</i> mua.</li>
  <li><i>I</i> mua.</li>
  <li><i>O</i> mua.</li>
  <li><i>Hei</i> mua.</li>
  <li><i>A</i> hea?</li>
  <li><i>Ko</i> ahea?</li>
  <li><i>Hei</i> ahea?</li>
  <li><i>Mo</i> ahea?</li>
  <li><i>No</i> nahea?</li>
  <li><i>I</i> nahea?</li>
  <li><i>A</i> muri.</li>
  <li><i>Ko</i> muri.</li>
  <li><i>No</i> muri.</li>
  <li><i>Na</i> muri.</li>
  <li><i>I</i> muri.</li>
  <li><i>Mo</i> muri.</li>
  <li><i>Ma</i> muri.</li>
  <li><i>Ki</i> muri.</li>
  <li><i>Kei</i> muri.</li>
  <li><i>I</i> muri.</li>
  <li><i>O</i> muri.</li>
  <li><i>Ko</i> anaianei.</li>
  <li><i>Hei</i> anaianei.</li>
  <li><i>Mo</i> anaianei.</li>
  <li><i>I</i> naianei.</li>
  <li><i>O</i> naianei.</li>
</ul>

<p class="nodent"><i>Reira</i>, <i>ko</i> and <i>konei</i>, &amp;c.,
will take the same combination as <i>muri</i>. It will be observed
that some of the above adverbs take <i>n</i> between them and the
preposition.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_19" id="F_19" href="#R_19">[19]</a>&#8195;
<i>Ka mutu</i>, and <i>ka mea</i> generally denote future time, and
imply a short interval between the time of speaking and the act.
Though the former <i>expresses</i> an <i>ending</i> of something else,
it does not always <i>intend</i> it; for it is often used when the
person addressed is not engaged at any thing. As there is nothing in
Maori corresponding exactly to the Hebraic mode of phrase which is
translated "<i>it came to pass</i>," "<i>it shall come to pass</i>,"
some have adapted <i>ka mea</i> as a substitute, and in some cases,
perhaps, it must stand for want of better. There are, however, cases
in which we think a more correct and idiomatic form might be adopted;
viz.:&mdash;a simple <i>a</i>, or <i>nawai a</i> or <i>tenei ake</i>,
&amp;c. We, for example, should have no scruple in translating the
following sentences "<i>so it came to pass when all the men of war
were consumed</i>," &amp;c., nawai a, ka poto nga tangata hapai patu
katoa te mate, &amp;c., "<i>and it shall come to pass if ye
hearken</i>," &amp;c., a tenei ake, ki te whakarongo koutou, &amp;c.,
"<i>and it came to pass when he heard</i>," &amp;c., a, te rongonga o,
&amp;c.</p>

The <i>tangata wero</i>, is the person who advances to
meet a party, and throws a spear at them. If, in turning to retire, he
turns to the side different from that from which the spear was darted,
it is a huri koaro, and a bad omen.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_22" id="F_22" href="#R_22">[22]</a>&#8195;
<i>Tahanga</i> is only to be found as adverb.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_23" id="F_23" href="#R_23">[23]</a>&#8195;
<i>Ae</i>, and <i>ina</i> do not always strictly imply
<i>affirmation</i>; e.&nbsp;g., Kahore he kete? He kete ano; <i>ae
ra</i>, tikina atu. <i>Is there no basket? There is a basket; yes,
then, go fetch it.</i> The word <i>answer</i> in Hebrew, and that
corresponding to it in the Greek Testament and Septuagint, affords, we
think, a parallel to this use of <i>ae</i>. (vid. Parkhurst's Greek
Lexicon, by Rose.) It is putting a <i>command</i>, &amp;c., into the
form of <i>an assent</i> to some previous sentence.&mdash;N.B.
<i>Ina</i> is often used to denote <i>energy</i>, <i>certainty</i>,
&amp;c.; e.&nbsp;g., <i>ina</i> ka riri au, <i>certainly</i>, in that
case, I will be angry.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_24" id="F_24" href="#R_24">[24]</a>&#8195;
Some, we believe, maintain that the adverb
<i>besides</i> should be always rendered by <i>haunga</i>. It is true
that, wherever <i>exclusion</i> or <i>negation</i> is indicated by
that word, <i>haunga</i> will generally answer; e.&nbsp;g., E rua tekau
ratou, <i>haunga</i> nga wahine, <i>they were twenty, besides (that is
not counting) the women</i>. In the leading sense, however, of
<i>besides</i>, viz., that of <i>moreover</i>, <i>addition to</i>,
haunga will, we are sure, seldom find an use; as in the following
examples: "<i>Besides</i> you know," "nobody thinks so <i>besides</i>
yourself," "there is nothing there <i>besides</i> the box,"
"<i>besides</i> her he had no child."</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_25" id="F_25" href="#R_25">[25]</a>&#8195;
Some foreigners, we observe, give this adverb a more extensive meaning
than we have allowed it. In such phrases, for example, as the
following: "Held by the hand," "built by the hand," &amp;c., they
would say "purutia <i>a</i> ringaringatia," "hanga <i>a</i>
ringaringa." We are, however, decidedly of opinion that such
expressions are very rare in genuine Maori. "Purutia ringaringatia,
hanga e te ringa," are, we consider, in every way preferable.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_26" id="F_26" href="#R_26">[26]</a>&#8195;
<i>Koia</i>, when part of an interrogative sentence, is,
as far as we have observed, (although we are aware that some
respectable speakers of Maori have not followed the rule,) almost
always used in <i>rejoinder</i>; e.&nbsp;g., I pehea <i>koia</i> ahau?
<i>what then did I say?</i> The speaker here supposes that the hearer
had disputed his statement, and uses <i>koia</i>. <i>Oti</i> is used
in a somewhat similar construction with the meaning of <i>else</i>,
e.&nbsp;g., He aha oti? <i>what else then is it?</i></p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_27" id="F_27" href="#R_27">[27]</a>&#8195;
It has been objected by a learned friend that the
compound prepositions are more properly adverbs, and that in such a
sentence as "kei roto i te whare," <i>i</i> is the governing
preposition, and <i>roto</i> is an adverb. With all deference,
however, to his very superior critical abilities, we submit, that if a
preposition be "a particle denoting the relation of one substantive to
another" then <i>roto</i> is a preposition; for it clearly indicates a
local relation between <i>roto</i> (or <i>i roto</i>, if you please,)
and the thing spoken of. Those who feel sceptical on this point, we
would beg to examine the composite prepositions of Hebrew. For
example, the Hebrew preposition <i>under</i> (<i>tahath</i>) is
recognised as a preposition by grammarians, even though it may require
the prepositions <i>from</i> and <i>to</i> in combination with it to
exhibit its meaning. So also, in English, such prepositions as
<i>according</i> to, <i>out</i> at, <i>out</i> of, &amp;c., are not
considered as disfranchised by the supplementary preposition annexed
to them. At the same time it is to be noted, that where there is a
break between the compound preposition and its supplement, then the
former must be considered as an adverb; thus, in the sentence, "Kei
raro, kei te whare," <i>it is below, it is in the house</i>;
<i>raro</i> is here, as it is in English, an adverb joined to
<i>is</i>; the line of connection being broken by a comma. In such a
construction as this, the same preposition that precedes the compound
preposition, (or rather, in this case, the <i>adverb</i>,) must also
follow it.</p>

<h2><span class="fs80">CHAPTER X.</span><br />OF THE PARTICLES.</h2>

<p>We have thought it better to devote a separate chapter to the
consideration of the following particles of Maori; first, because
those words, though they strongly partake of the nature of adverbs,
are yet sometimes used as conjunctions; secondly, because we are of
opinion that a distinct consideration of them will be the best way to
impart clear and comprehensive views of their nature.</p>

<p class="small">An accurate acquaintance with these <i>epea
pteroenta</i> "winged words" of discourse, is in most languages of
very difficult attainment: but in Maori, particularly, do they require
our study; that language not conceding to the verb the same prominent
place that it occupies in other languages, and rather, (as we have
already observed,) transacting the business of predication by
pronouns, particles, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="small">They are mainly used for embellishing, defining, and
impressing a sentence, and may, with the prepositions, be justly
denominated the hinges of Maori.</p>

<p class="small">To enumerate them all would be an endless task, and
perhaps a useless one: for, in no part of Maori is there so great a
discrepancy in the various districts. The following, we think, are the
most general in use, and most deserving of notice: atu, mai, ake, iho,
ai, ano, ra, koa, u, hoki, kau.</p>

<p><i>Atu</i> and <i>mai</i> are, in most respects, exactly opposite;
<i>atu</i> indicates an <i>emanation forth</i> of action from&mdash;the
latter an <i>approach</i> or <i>direction</i> towards&mdash;the speaker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span></p>

<table class="tbl" summary="atu-mai">
 <tr><td>E kore ahau e rongo <i>atu</i>, <i>I do not hear</i> forth.</td>
     <td class="left">E kore e rongo <i>mai</i>, <i>will not hear
         towards (me or us)</i>.</td></tr>
 <tr><td></td>
     <td class="left">E rangona <i>mai</i> ranei tatou? <i>shall we be heard towards
         (us)?</i></td></tr>
 <tr><td>Tu <i>atu</i>, <i>stand out of my way</i>.</td>
     <td class="left">Kati <i>mai</i> i kona, <i>stand towards me there</i>.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Tikina <i>atu</i>, <i>go there and bring here</i>, i.&nbsp;e.,
         <i>fetch thence</i>.</td>
     <td class="left">Tikina <i>mai</i>, <i>fetch hence</i>.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>E tatari <i>atu</i> ana matou ki a koe, <i>we are waiting forth
         to you</i>.</td>
     <td class="left"></td></tr>
 <tr><td>E kore ahau e kaha <i>atu</i>, <i>I shall not be strong
         forth</i>, i.&nbsp;e., <i>shall not be able to take it
         there</i>.</td>
     <td class="left">Mau <i>mai</i> ano, <i>for you truly hither</i>, i.&nbsp;e.,
         <i>it is for you to strike the first blow</i>, &amp;c.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="small">N.B.&mdash;<i>Atu</i> will sometimes lose its
peculiar meaning after a verb, (vid. verbs, S.) It will also
occasionally stand for <i>other</i>: Tera atu ano, <i>that is
another</i>; i.&nbsp;e., there are other besides.</p>

<p><i>Ake</i> and <i>Iho</i>. The general uses of <i>ake</i> and
<i>iho</i> are, of the former <i>up</i>, and of the latter
<i>down</i>, to the speaker:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Haere <i>ake</i>, <i>come up (to us)</i>.</li>
  <li>Heke <i>iho</i>, <i>come down (to us)</i>.</li>
  <li>E tu <i>iho</i>, <i>he stands up there</i>, i.&nbsp;e., <i>down towards
    (us)</i>.</li>
  <li>Te mea e ngangautia <i>ake</i>, <i>the thing about which there is
    that contention below</i>, (lit. is contended <i>up towards</i>
    (us)).</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes they will stand, the one for <i>up</i>, the other for
<i>down</i>, to the object of the action; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>E kore ahau e roa <i>ake</i>, <i>I am not tall enough to reach up
  (to it)</i>.</li>
  <li>Ho <i>ake</i> ki a ia, <i>give it up to him</i>.</li>
  <li><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89"
  id="page_89">{89}</a></span>Pataia <i>iho</i> te mate, <i>ask down
  (to him) his sickness</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Ake</i> and <i>iho</i> will sometimes denote <i>propriety</i>,
<i>peculiarity</i>, <i>self-existence</i>, &amp;c.; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Maku <i>ake</i> ano, <i>for myself alone</i>.</li>
  <li>Mona <i>iho</i> ano tena, <i>that is for himself alone</i>.</li>
  <li>E hara i te toka tu <i>ake</i>, <i>not a rock that has stood of
    itself</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Ake</i> will sometimes signify <i>the other side</i> of the
speaker, whether it be <i>before</i>, <i>behind</i>, <i>to one side
of</i>, <i>above</i>, <i>below</i>, &amp;c.; e.&nbsp;g., <i>haere ake</i> to a
hearer in front will mean come <i>behind me</i>: to a person behind,
it will signify come <i>to my front</i>.</p>

<p class="small">N.B.&mdash;<i>Iho</i> does not seem to have any
corresponding opposite to this meaning of <i>ake</i>.</p>

<p>Sometimes, also, <i>ake</i> is employed to designate a
motion by another towards some place with which the
speaker is in connexion; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Ka mea, ka haere <i>ake</i> ki Waitemata, <i>follow me by and bye to
    Waitemata</i>.</li>
  <li>He aha te tikina <i>ake</i> ai he ti ma te turoro nei? <i>why has
    not tea been fetched (from my residence) for this patient?</i></li>
  <li>E puta mai, ka karanga <i>ake</i> ki a au, <i>when he comes you will
    call to me, (who am now going away)</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Under these two last rules should, perhaps, be mentioned the following
examples:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Tangohia <i>ake</i> te ngarara i taku tuara, <i>take the insect off
    my back</i>.</li>
  <li>Ma koutou e urunga <i>ake</i>, <i>do you of the bow of the canoe
    steer</i>, i.&nbsp;e., <i>so paddle that the stern, where I am, may be
    directed rightly</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note 1.</span>&mdash;There are
other subordinate meanings of <i>ake</i> and <i>iho</i>, of which
examples have been given under the adverbs, and which do not, we
think, require any further notice.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90"
id="page_90">{90}</a></span><span class="smcap">Note
2.</span>&mdash;<i>Ake</i> and <i>iho</i> are often used after verbs,
in a manner somewhat corresponding to that of the verbal particles.
(vid. verbs. S.)</p>

<p><i>Ai</i> is a particle of great use. It is chiefly employed as a
substitute for the relatives <i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>what</i>,
and has reference to the <i>time</i>, <i>place</i>, <i>manner</i>,
<i>cause</i>, <i>means</i>, <i>intention</i>, &amp;c., of an action; as in
the following examples:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>No te ra horoi whare i haere mai <i>ai</i>, <i>started for here on
    Saturday</i>.</li>
  <li>I tona kitenga <i>ai</i>, <i>when it was seen</i>.</li>
  <li>Te whare i moe <i>ai</i> ia, <i>the house in which he slept</i>.</li>
  <li>Te peheatanga i meatia <i>ai</i>, <i>the way in which it was
    done</i>.</li>
  <li>Te take i patua <i>ai</i>, <i>the cause for which he was beaten</i>.</li>
  <li>Ma te aha e ora <i>ai</i>? <i>by what means be saved?</i></li>
  <li>I tuhituhi <i>ai</i> au nau hoki i utu i ena riwai, <i>I have
    written to you because you paid for the other potatoes</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Occasionally, however, it is heard as a simple expletive; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>I mua <i>ai</i>, <i>formerly</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>2ndly. It is employed with the verbs to denote a <i>sequence</i> and,
occasionally, an <i>opposition</i> of action, and might be translated
by "<i>and then</i>," "<i>to</i>," and sometimes "<i>but</i>."</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Haere, ka hoki mai <i>ai</i>, <i>go, and then return</i>.</li>
  <li>Haere ki reira noho <i>ai</i>, <i>go there to stop</i>.</li>
  <li>Kua hereherea, noho <i>ai</i>, kawea atu ana ki a te Paki, <i>she
    was enslaved, and remained such</i> for some time, <i>then was
    carried to Paki</i>.</li>
  <li>Ko te pa ano tera; noho <i>ai</i> ia ki Horotiu, <i>that indeed is
    his village; but he dwells at Horotiu</i>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="small">
<p>Sometimes, especially at Taupo, and, we understand,
at the East Cape, <i>ai</i> is often used where the <i>sequence</i> or
<i>opposition</i> of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91"
id="page_91">{91}</a></span>action is but faintly, if at all,
expressed. The following is correct in Waikato: E pa, kei hea tetahi
wahi mo matou? kokoa kotoatia <i>ai</i> e koe te whenua nei, <i>friend
where is there a portion for us? why you have monopolized the whole of
the land</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note 1.</span>&mdash;The place of <i>ai</i> may
be often supplied by <i>nei</i>, <i>na</i>, or <i>ra</i>; e.&nbsp;g.,
koia ahau i haere mai <i>nei</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note 2.</span>&mdash;<i>Ai</i> is often
erroneously omitted and erroneously introduced by foreigners, and
those who wish to propound a statement accurately will do well to
observe its use.</p>

<p>For <i>ai</i>, as used in connexion with the verbal particles, and
the verbs. (See Syntax.)</p>
</div>

<p><i>Ano.</i> This is a particle much used in assertions and replies.
Its meaning will vary with that of the word to which it is postfixed.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>Indeed</i>; Tenei <i>ano</i> nga tangata o toku kainga te mahi
    nei i te kino, Here <i>truly</i> are the people, &amp;c.</li>
  <li>Ko ia <i>ano</i> te tikanga o te aroha, <i>id</i> demum <i>est firma
    amicitia</i>.</li>
  <li>Naku <i>ano</i> taku, <i>mine is my own</i>.</li>
  <li>Kati <i>ano</i>, <i>stop I say, (or beg of you)</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Also</i>; No Waikato ahau, no Rotorua <i>ano</i>, <i>I am from
    Waikato, from Rotorua also</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Only</i>; Kotahi <i>ano</i> taku, <i>one only is mine</i>.
    (<i>Anake</i> would not here be used.)</li>
  <li><i>Immediately</i>, akuanei <i>nei ano</i>, now <i>instantly</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Same</i>; Ko nga kau <i>ano</i> nga kau, <i>they are the very
    same cows</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Different</i>; He tangata <i>ano</i> tena, <i>that belongs to
    another person</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Again</i> or <i>another</i>; Tikina <i>ano</i>, <i>fetch
    another</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Same as</i>; <i>Ano</i> e moe ana, <i>as if he were sleeping</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Self</i>; Mana <i>ano</i>, <i>for himself</i>.</li>
  <li>I whakaae mai ranei? I whakaae <i>ano</i>. Was he willing? He was
    willing.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is used in combination with other particles, as follows:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Heoi <i>ano</i>, <i>that is all</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Ano</i> hoki, <i>also</i>.</li>
  <li><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_92"
  id="page_92">{92}</a></span>Ra <i>ano</i>, <i>until</i>.</li>
  <li>Nei <i>ano</i>, <i>this is it, or here it is</i>, &amp;c.</li>
  <li>Koia <i>ano</i>! <i>how (fine, &amp;c.)!</i></li>
  <li>A, e noho nei <i>ano</i>? <i>and is he still here?</i></li>
  <li><i>Ano ra</i>, whakarongo mai, <i>(yes, or no;) but listen to
      me</i>; i.&nbsp;e., <i>I do not deny what you say; only listen to
      me</i>.</li>
  <li>Ko tena <i>ano</i> ra, <i>that one I say, or that also</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Ano</i>, in the beginning of sentences, seems with Ngapuhi to admit
of a wider application than what is generally heard in Waikato; e.&nbsp;g.,
<i>Ano</i> ka tae ki te whare, <i>and when he came to the house</i>.</p>

<p class="small">N.B.&mdash;<i>No</i>, also, with the same people,
seems to admit of a somewhat similar application.</p>

<p><i>Ra</i> is a particle corresponding in its use with <i>nei</i> and
<i>ra</i>, and is frequently used to supply the place of the relative
<i>which</i>; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>I kite <i>ra</i> koe, <i>which you saw</i>.</li>
  <li><i>There</i>; e takoto mai <i>ra</i>, <i>it lies there</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is sometimes used in commands and energetic sentences, for
<i>Then</i>.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Haere <i>ra</i>, <i>go then</i>.</li>
  <li>Heoi ano <i>ra</i>, <i>that is all about it then</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Often in replies; E pai ana? Ae <i>ra</i>.</p>

<p><i>Koa</i> is a particle used mostly in correcting, &amp;c., another
speaker or oneself:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>E pa, e he ana <i>koa</i> koe, <i>O my friend you are wrong</i>.</li>
  <li>Aana <i>koa</i>, <i>yes (you are right)</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is difficult to define its meaning in the following phrases:</p>

</ul>

<p><i>U</i> is often used as a mere expletive. Sometimes it has force in
exculpatory sentences; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>E taea te aha <i>u</i> ana i te mamae? <i>how could the poor fellow
    help it from the pain</i>?</li>
</ul>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Though often
used as an expletive, <i>u</i> will not, however, admit of being
thrust into every sentence. Some foreigners seem peculiarly fond of
using it. The following use of it is, at least in Waikato, erroneous:
"A he tangata nui hoki a Hone, he rangatira hoki <i>u</i> a ratou." We
are unable, we confess, to state the meaning of this last clause. The
speaker, perhaps, intended the preposition <i>no</i> by <i>u a</i>, "a
chief of their party."</p>

<p><i>Hoki</i>; Some of the uses of <i>hoki</i> have been inserted under
the adverbs. We shall give a brief view of the principal of them here.
Its more general uses are, <i>also</i>, <i>for</i>, <i>because</i>:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>He mea hoki</i> ka tae mai ahau, <i>in consideration of my having
    come</i>.</li>
  <li>Koia <i>hoki</i>, <i>yes truly (he is right)</i>, &amp;c.</li>
  <li>Ina <i>hoki</i>, (the same as <i>mei</i> of Waikato,) viz., <i>as
    you may judge from</i>.</li>
  <li>Kahore ano i tae mai, <i>ina hoki</i> te pu, te rangona, <i>he has
    not arrived, as we may judge from the gun, its not being heard</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Nei hoki</i>, and <i>na</i>, or <i>ra</i>, hoki; Hopukia te
    poaka; Kua mau <i>ra</i> hoki, <i>oh, it has been caught</i>.</li>
  <li>Kati te tohe, kua riro atu <i>nei hoki</i> te utu, <i>cease
    importuning; inasmuch as the payment has been given</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This form we approve much of for expressing the following: "for the
death of the Lord Jesus Christ," kua mate <i>nei hoki</i>, &amp;c., i.&nbsp;e.,
<i>inasmuch as</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Ki te titaha <i>hoki ra</i>, <i>well then, (if you won't give that,)
    give me an axe</i>.</li>
  <li>Ho mai <i>hoki</i>, <i>give it I say</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Kau</i>; Riri <i>kau</i>, <i>angry without cause</i>.</p>

  <li>E mau <i>kau</i> ana te taura, <i>is</i> barely <i>fastened</i>,
    i.&nbsp;e., <i>it has only the name of being fastened</i>.</li>

Hebrew, and may be recognised in our translations as occupying the

Those who have not access to Professor Gesenius' Hebrew Lexicon, will,
we are sure, read with pleasure his remarks upon its parallel in
Hebrew. "It was a part of the simplicity of ancient language to mark
merely the connexion of ideas, without expressing those nice
distinctions of thought, which are designated by the use of
<i>causal</i>, <i>adversative</i>, <i>disjunctive</i>, and other
conjunctions. The prefix <i>vahv</i> retains this variety of
signification, though other more definite conjunctions are also in
use." This is precisely the case with Maori.</p>

<p><i>Ina</i>, <i>ua</i>, (<i>ana</i>, Waikato) <i>when</i>; <i>Ina</i>
korero ahau, <i>when</i> I speak.</p>

<p><i>If</i>, (occasionally,) chiefly in cases in which contingency is
attached to <i>when</i>:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">

<p class="small"><i>Heoi</i> (Ngapuhi), and heoti (Waikato), is a
particle which corresponds sometimes with <i>a</i>, and <i>na</i>, in
its uses. It generally, however, implies opposition, and might be
translated by <i>but</i>, &amp;c. Sometimes also, it has the meaning
of <i>so</i>, <i>then</i>, and sometimes, (particularly in Waikato,)
it is, in the end of sentences, redundant.</p>

</ul>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Ahakoa will
almost always precede in the sentence, e.&nbsp;g., The following
"though we were sinners he loved us," should thus be rendered
<i>ahakoa</i> hara noa tatou arohaina ana tatou e ia.</p>

<p>Following are a few examples of phrases which supply the place of
conjunctions:</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>Ki te</i> kahore e pai, <i>if</i> he is not pleased.</li>
  <li><i>Ki te wa</i> haere, <i>if</i> you go.</li>

  <li><i>Pera hoki me</i> Hana e whakatoi nei, <i>just as Hana teases</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Mana</i> ka tika, <i>mana</i> ka he, <i>even though</i>, (no
    matter whether,) <i>it be right or wrong</i>.</li>
  <li>Ko reira, <i>then</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The particle <i>ai</i> is very useful in supplying the place of
conjunctions. (Vid. our remarks on it.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_28" id="F_28" href="#R_28">[28]</a>&#8195;
This particle will often supply a good substitute for
<i>with</i>, when it denotes connexion, &amp;c., a meaning which we
believe to be but seldom expressed by <i>ki</i>. (vid. prepositions,
page 55.)</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_29" id="F_29" href="#R_29">[29]</a>&#8195;
Some foreigners, we observe, use <i>me i mua</i>; this,
however, is decidedly erroneous.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_30" id="F_30" href="#R_30">[30]</a>&#8195;
The learned student will, however, notice that these
words, as well as <i>keia</i>, are only prefixed to conclusions which
are the <i>natural and necessary effect</i> of a preceding
proposition. For example, we might use <i>mo reira</i>, &amp;c., in such a
sentence as the following: "Men are sinners, <i>therefore</i> men are
exposed to the wrath of God:" because the preceding proposition is
clearly a <i>cause</i> of the latter.</p>

<p class="nodent">We could not, however, use any of them in such
propositions as the following: "the Tohungas are liars,
<i>therefore</i> the New Zealander listens to liars;" "the Sun shines,
<i>therefore</i> the sun is a luminous body;" "man is an animal,
<i>therefore</i> man has sensation;" because it would not be true to
say, that, because the Tohunga is a liar, he is therefore listened to;
because the sun shines it is luminous; or, because man is an animal he
has sensation.</p>

<p class="nodent">Wherever, then, the connection with the preceding
proposition is either <i>accidental</i> or <i>abstract</i>, we must
have recourse to other words, such as <i>na</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>ra</i>,
<i>pea</i>, &amp;c., and these are largely used in our translations.
(vid. Mat. 5, 37&mdash;24&mdash;42, and N. T. <i>passim</i>.)</p>

<p class="nodent">The affirmative particles <i>ina</i> and <i>ae
ra</i> will often supply a good substitute, and will perhaps be
logically correct. For the conclusion is the proposition that we <i>in
principio</i> affirm to be true, and having proved it, we then
authoritatively pronounce it to be so. (vid. our remarks on <i>ae</i>,
&amp;c., note, under adverbs of <i>affirmation</i>.)</p>

<h2><span class="fs80">CHAPTER XII.</span><br />OF THE INTERJECTIONS.</h2>

<p>Maori abounds in interjections. The following are the most common. It
will be seen in this part of speech that there is a considerable
variation in the different tribes.</p>

<p class="nodent">INTERJECTIONS.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>For calling to another person near at hand</i>, Ou! Ou!</li>
  <li><i>For reply to recall</i>, O, (in a falsetto tone).</li>
  <li><i>For drawing attention to statements, things</i> &amp;c., &amp;c.<br />
    Inana! irara! ira! (Rotorua).<br />
    Aiaiai! (Taranaki).<br />
    Rere! Ere! nene! re! (Waikato).<br />
    Nana! (Ngapuhi).</li>
  <li><i>For exciting attention</i>, rara! (Waikato).</li>
  <li><i>Disapprobatory</i>, E, e! He! hi! ha! aeha! &#257;r&#257;r&#257;.
    Ata! (Ngapuhi) Ae!</li>
</ul>

<p>Exclamations made when it has been found that the speaker was correct,
(corresponding to <i>ah</i>, <i>you see!</i> <i>yes</i>, <i>to be
sure</i>, &amp;c.) Na ra nei? Ar&#259;r&#259;! haka! (Waikato,) aheiha
(Ngapuhi,) ae ra hoki. That expressive of gratification at some
misfortune having befallen another; Kaitoa!</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>Of salutation to visitors</i>, Haere mai, haere mai!
    Tauti mai, (Waikato). Nau mai, (Rotorua).</li>
  <li><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100"
  id="page_100">{100}</a></span><i>Salutation of one meeting
  another</i>, Tena ra ko koe! or, Tena koe! (lit, <i>that is you</i>).</li>
  <li><i>In reply to a salutation</i>, Ko koe ra! It is you!</li>
  <li><i>Of farewell</i>, Hei konei, <i>stop!</i> Haere, go!
    E noho! ne? <i>Remain! Will you?</i></li>
  <li><i>Of wonder</i>, Aue! Eue! (Waikato) Taukiri e! A!
    He inati! (Waikato).</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides these there are phrases which are often used
as interjections; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>Ka tae</i> taku matua, &amp;c.! <i>Bravo, my father</i>, &amp;c.,
    corresponding to our <i>thank you</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Ka tae</i> he mamahi mau! <i>what heavy work for you</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Tauhou</i> ki a Hone! (lit. <i>stranger to John!</i>) <i>Oh
    yes, Mr. John</i>.</li>
  <li>Ka mahi a Hone, idem.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maori delights in interjectional and ironical sentences, and the
student who desires to be a good speaker should pay them much
attention, and study also to catch the tone of voice, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Some, who have not noticed them, have turned an exclamation into a
question, and thus altered the meaning of the sentence. "How many pigs
of John have better food than I!" we have heard thus translated, E hia
ranei nga poaka a Hone he pai ke ta ratou kai i taku, &amp;c.? The
translation here obviously differs from the original. It should have
been, <i>Ano te tini</i>, or <i>tini noa iho</i>, or <i>ka tae te
tini</i>, or <i>kia tini</i>, <i>na</i>, (or <i>ano</i>) <i>te
tini</i>, or <i>he tini nga poaka</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>And here we may observe that, in translating from another tongue
into Maori, it would be perverting all use of language to render by
merely a verbal correspondence, without any regard to the meaning; and
that, in these idiomatic phrases, it would be best, unless we wish to
establish the maxim of the French statesman,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_31" id="R_31" href="#F_31">[31]</a></span> "that language was
merely intended to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101"
id="page_101">{101}</a></span>conceal our feelings," to make our
author employ those corresponding expressions in Maori which he would
most probably have used had he been speaking in that language.</p>

<p>We may observe, in conclusion, that Maori has no good form for such
optative interjections as <i>would that</i>, &amp;c. There is, it is true,
a kind of substitute; but it cannot be expressed by our present
alphabet. It is formed by a sharp smack of the tongue against the
palate, and <i>na</i> pronounced after it. The best form, for the
present, is, perhaps, <i>me i</i>, with a peculiar tone of voice;
e.&nbsp;g., <i>Me i</i> kite ahau ia ia! If I had but seen him! or would
that I had, &amp;c.</p>

<h2><span class="fs80">CHAPTER XIII.</span><br />OF THE SYNTAX.<br />
<span class="fs80">PRELIMINARY REMARKS.</span></h2>

<p>Before we proceed to the consideration of the Syntax of Maori, it will
be necessary 1st. to explain some terms which we shall be obliged to
employ, and 2ndly, to make a few remarks on the general features of
Maori sentences. Some further remarks on this subject, we shall
reserve till we come to treat on the verbs.</p>

<p>The <i>subject</i> of a proposition is that concerning which anything
is affirmed or denied. The <i>predicate</i> is that which is so
affirmed or denied of the subject. Thus, in the following sentence,
Kua mate a Hone, <i>John has died</i>, <i>Hone</i> is the subject, and
<i>mate</i> is the predicate.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;We can
scarcely recognize the verbal particles as copulas. We believe that
their exclusive use is, to denote time.</p>

<p>Propositions, or sentences, we divided (page 37) into <i>simple</i>
and <i>compound</i>. Another division is here necessary; viz., into
<i>complex</i> and <i>incomplex</i>. An <i>incomplex proposition</i>
is that whose subject and predicate are simple terms; e.&nbsp;g., He hoiho
tenei, <i>this is a horse</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103"
id="page_103">{103}</a></span>A complex proposition is that which
contains some qualifying, or otherwise modifying, term in connexion
with either <i>subject</i> or <i>predicate</i>; e.&nbsp;g., I mate a
Hone <i>ki reira</i>. <i>Ki reira</i>, here, qualifies the predicate
<i>mate</i>. He tokomaha nga Pakeha i Akarana, <i>many are the
foreigners in Auckland</i>. Nga Pakeha i Akarana is the
<i>subject</i>, and tokomaha the <i>predicate</i>.</p>

<p>He aroha no te Atua i ora ai tatou. This placed in due order, is "I
ora ai tatou, he aroha no te Atua," <i>we having been saved was a love
of God</i>. Here, <i>I ora ai tatou</i> is the subject.</p>

<p>Ko tou utu tena mo to hanganga i te whare? <i>Is that your payment for
your having built the house?</i> Here, we conceive, <i>ko tou utu mo
to hanganga i te whare</i> is the <i>subject</i>, and <i>tena</i> the
<i>predicate</i>.</p>

<div class="small">
<p>In examining the nature of Maori propositions, the student will soon
notice that they are characterized by a remarkable <i>brevity</i> and
<i>abruptness</i>, as well as by the frequent occurrence of ellipses.
As a New Zealander is generally unequal to a train of consecutive
thought, so also is his language inadequate to exhibit with accuracy
the various processes of the civilized intellect, such as comparing,
abstracting, &amp;c., or indeed any ideas beyond the simple and
monotonous details of his daily life. It is, if we may so speak, an
animated sketching, intended for general effect, the more delicate
lines being but faintly touched.</p>

<p>The student has already seen that Maori is defective in particles of
<i>illation</i>, <i>comparison</i>, and <i>copulation</i>. The want
of a verb substantive, which is so useful as a <i>copula</i> in other
languages, will often, where accuracy is desired, cause both
clumsiness and obscurity of construction.</p>

<p>The process by which a New Zealander constructs his sentences, is
very similar to that of a child who is just beginning to speak. For
example: if the latter wishes to express, "Is that a horse?" "Give me
some bread," he will, most probably, say "a horse that?" "me bread."
He has the ideas of <i>himself</i> and <i>bread</i>, and, by
pronouncing the one in immediate succession after the other, attempts
to convey the idea of their mutual connexion. So also will Maori,
when it wishes to express the dependence of two or more ideas on each
other, place them in close connexion, as distinct existences, and
leave the hearer to deduce their intended relations. From hence it
may, <i>a priori</i>, be collected. 1st. That Maori inclines to the
<i>substantive form</i>. 2ndly, That it <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104"
id="page_104">{104}</a></span>will have a peculiar tendency to the
<i>indicative mode of statement</i>. 3rdly. That it delights in short
sentences. 4thly. That it will often, in consequence of the frequent
occurrence of ellipses, present constructions which will appear
<i>strange</i> to the student of only polished languages, and even
occasionally seem to defy analysis. 5thly, That the clauses of the
sentence, will, like its words, be often thrown together without any
connecting particles, and that we shall often notice in their
construction a frequent occurrence of <i>epanorthosis</i>.</p>

<p>On some of these heads we shall have to remark hereafter. The
last-mentioned feature is, however, of such importance in the
investigation of some of the difficult points of Maori, that we must
beg the student's leave to bring it here prominently before his
notice.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Epanorthosis</i> is a figure of frequent occurrence in all
languages, but particularly in those of the East. It is "the
qualifying a former clause by the addition of another"<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_32" id="R_32" href="#F_32">[32]</a></span>
e.&nbsp;g., Ka tae te hohoro o ta tatou kai, <i>te pau</i>! what great
haste our food has made; (I mean) <i>the being consumed</i>. Here
<i>te pau</i>, is a clause qualifying the preceding; e rua tahi enei,
<i>he roa kau</i>, there are two here, <i>nothing but long</i>;
ringihia mai, <i>kia nohinohi</i>, pour me out some, <i>let it be
little</i>, (i.&nbsp;e., pour me out a little); e rite tahi ana ia kia
koe, <i>te ahua</i>, he is like you, (I mean,) <i>the countenance</i>;
no reira a Ngatihau i tino mau ai, <i>te karakia ai</i>, that was the
cause why Ngatihau were quite established, (I mean,) <i>the not
adopting Christianity</i>. I riri au kia ia, <i>kihai nei i
whakaaro</i>, I was angry with him, (I mean,) <i>he did not exercise
thought in that matter</i>. Ko te tangata tenei, nana nga kakano, this
is the man, <i>his are the seeds</i>; (i.&nbsp;e., <i>this is the
person whose are</i>, &amp;c.) He aha tau e mea, what is yours
(actively) (I mean,) <i>are doing</i>? i.&nbsp;e., <i>what are you
doing?</i> Haere ana Hone, me tana hoiho. Ka puta pea tena ki raro,
<i>e tihore ana</i>. So John started and his horse. He has perhaps
reached to the northward, (I mean,) <i>is</i> <span class="pagenum"><a

<p class="small">6thly. The student may be prepared to find the defect
of the verb substantive supplied in various ways in Maori&mdash;by the
article, the pronoun, the preposition, the adverb, and the verbal
particles. Instances of ellipsis he will find in almost every
page&mdash;ellipsis of the verb, of the noun, of the pronoun, &amp;c.,
and, particularly, in our illustration of the preposition
<i>ki</i>.</p>

<p class="small">As distinctions between gender, number, case, and
person, are very rare in Maori, and as, moreover, a main business of
syntax consists in the adjusting of their several claims, we may hope
that our work here will be neither complicated, nor extended.</p>

<h2><span class="fs80">CHAPTER XIV.</span><br />SYNTAX OF THE ARTICLE.</h2>

<p>1. <i>Ko</i> is never used before appellatives without either
<i>te</i>, <i>te tahi</i>, and its plural <i>e tahi</i>, or one of the
possessive pronouns intervening, and it is almost always found to
occupy the first place in the sentence; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>ko</i> taku tamaiti, <i>this is my child</i>.</li>
  <li><i>ko</i> e tahi kua kitea, <i>some were seen</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>2. In this position a very common use of it is, to imply the verb
substantive.</p>

<p>3. The article <i>he</i>, it will be seen, does not require its help
for such a purpose; e.&nbsp;g., <i>he</i> rakau tenei, <i>this is a
tree</i>; <i>he</i> mate toku, <i>a sickness is mine</i>, i.&nbsp;e., I am
sick.</p>

<p>4. All the functions of <i>a</i> (vid. page 13) are performed by
<i>ko</i>, when the noun, &amp;c., to which it is prefixed, precede in the
sentence; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>Ko</i> koe te haere, <i>you are the person that is to go</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Ko</i> runga kau i kainga, <i>the tops only were eaten</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>5. Sometimes it will be found in other parts of the sentence,
(<i>a</i>) when the terms, of which the sentence is composed, are
convertible,<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_33" id="R_33"
href="#F_33">[33]</a></span> or are intended, at <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_107" id="page_107">{107}</a></span>least, to be represented as
similar; e.&nbsp;g., <i>ko</i> te timunga atu o konei <i>ko</i> te pakeketanga o
waho, <i>the ebbing of the tide from here is low water outside</i>.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>Me he mea <i>ko</i> Pahuru <i>ko</i> Ngakete, <i>if Pahuru had been
    Ngakete</i>, &amp;c.</li>
  <li><i>Ko</i> au ra <i>ko</i> ia, <i>I and he are (one.)</i></li>
</ul>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Sometimes, also, when there are two subjects
of which the same thing is affirmed, <i>ko</i> will be prefixed
to both; e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>Ko</i> Kukutai <i>ko</i> te Wherowhero, rite tahi raua,
    <i>Kukutai and Wherowhero, they are equal both of them</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>6. It will be seen in the above example that <i>ko</i> will sometimes
represent <i>and</i>; e.&nbsp;g., e takoto nei <i>ko</i> te pihi <i>ko</i>
te poro, <i>it lies here, both the piece, and the end (of the bar of
soap.)</i></p>

<p>7. Very frequently, also, <i>ko</i> may be denominated "the article of
specification and emphasis;" e.&nbsp;g., <i>Noku</i> tena paraikete,
<i>that blanket is mine</i>; <i>ko</i> taku paraikete tena, <i>that is
my blanket</i>. The former of these two sentences implies that the
blanket is his property; the latter denotes the same thing, with some
further specification; as being, for example, one that had been
previously <i>described</i>, <i>worn</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Again, <i>ko</i> Hone i haere, <i>John went</i>.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>I haere <i>a</i> Hone, <i>idem</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="small">Here also, there is, we think, a difference. The
latter sentence merely says that John went; the former that John, as
<i>contradistinguished</i> from some one else, was the person who
went; literally, <i>it was John (who) went</i>.</p>

<p>8. Sometimes also, in animated description, <i>ko</i> will follow
the verb; e.&nbsp;g., na ka hinga <i>ko</i> Haupokia, na ka hinga
<i>ko</i> Ngapaka, <i>then fell Haupokia, then fell Ngapaka</i>.</p>

<p>9. <i>Ko</i> will generally be prefixed to the subject,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_34" id="R_34" href="#F_34">[34]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108">{108}</a></span>e.&nbsp;g.,
<i>ko</i> ta te tangata kai <i>he</i> poaka, <i>he</i> riwai, <i>he</i> aha,
<i>he</i> aha, <i>the food for man is pork, potatoes, et cætera, et
cætera</i>; <i>ko</i> Oropi <i>te</i> whenua taonga, <i>Europe is the land
of property</i>.</p>

<p class="small">N.B.&mdash;There are some exceptions to this rule,
especially when tenei, &amp;c., are employed. (vid. etiam rule 5.)</p>

<p>10. <i>Ko</i> is always prefixed to every title or name of
men or things which stands alone without the verb;
e.&nbsp;g.,</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li>"<i>Ko</i> te karere o Nui Tireni," <i>the (Newspaper) the Karere o
    Nui Tireni</i>.</li>
  <li><i>Ko</i> Hone, <i>here is John, or, John</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Occasionally
we meet with an exception to this rule, in emphatic, elliptical, and
complementary clauses; e.&nbsp;g., in taunting; tou ngene, <i>your
ngene</i><span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_35" id="R_35"
href="#F_35">[35]</a></span>; taku tirohanga, <i>my looking</i>,
i.&nbsp;e., <i>when I looked</i>. Ka whati tera, te pa, <i>that was
discomfitted, the pa</i>. Vid. our illustrations of
<i>Epanorthosis</i> in <i>preliminary remarks</i>, page 104.</p>

<p>11. It is sometimes used in elliptical sentences like
the following: E pai ana ano; <i>ko</i> te maeke ra, <i>we are
willing; but the cold</i>, i.&nbsp;e., <i>we should be glad to go
only for the cold</i>; Haere ana ia, <i>ko</i> tona ko tahi, <i>he
went by himself alone</i>.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;It may be seen
in the above example that ko is sometimes used for <i>but</i>; so also
in the following: Me he mea ko te Paki, e rongo ratou; <i>ko tenei</i>
e kore e rongo, <i>if it had been Paki they would have listened</i>,
but <i>as for this, they will not listen</i>.</p>

<p>12. In connexion with the two preceding rules, we
may observe, that ko is almost always prefixed to the
nominative absolute; e.&nbsp;g., <i>ko taua kupu au</i>, e kore e
rangona, <i>as for that word of yours, it will not be
listened to</i>.</p>
<ul class="xmpl">
  <li><i>Ko te hunga whakapono</i>, ka ora ratou, <i>believers, they will
    be saved</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="small">N.B.&mdash;In some districts the ko is omitted under
this rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109"
id="page_109">{109}</a></span>13. <i>Nga</i> we have designated as the
plural of the <i>definite</i> article page 12. The student will
therefore remember that it does not recognize the rules <i>a</i>,
<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, mentioned under
<i>te</i>&mdash;pages 10 and 11.</p>

<p>14. <i>The omission of the article.</i></p>

<p>There are some cases in which no article is prefixed to the noun,
(<i>a</i>) when the noun follows immediately after the verb; e.&nbsp;g.,
Whakamate tangata, <i>murderous</i>; (vid. compound words page 17.)
Haere po, <i>go by night</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Nouns preceded by the adverbial particles <i>a</i> and
<i>tua</i>; e.&nbsp;g., tatau <i>a tangata</i>, <i>count man by man</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) When a possessive pronoun is associated with the noun; ho
mai toku kakahu, <i>give me my garment</i>.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;It is,
however, highly probable that the singular possessive pronouns, (vid.
page 29.) are compounded of the article <i>te</i>, and the plural form
<i>oku</i>, &amp;c., and that <i>oku</i>, <i>aku</i>, <i>ona</i>,
&amp;c., are compounded of <i>o</i> and <i>a</i>, and the personal
pronouns <i>ahau</i>, <i>koe</i>, <i>ia</i>: these pronouns assuming
the forms of <i>oku</i>, <i>ou</i>, <i>ona</i>, &amp;c., when in
connection with <i>o</i>, and <i>a</i>; in the same way as they adopt
the form of <i>mona</i>, <i>nona</i>, &amp;c., when in combination
with the prepositions <i>mo</i>, <i>no</i>, &amp;c., &amp;c. (vid. our
remarks on noku and maku page 22, and <i>tenei</i>, &amp;c., page 31.)
Sometimes, indeed, we find the singular possessive pronouns thus
resolved; e.&nbsp;g., kei <i>tenei</i> taha <i>oku</i>, on this side
<i>of me</i>. If it had not been for <i>nei</i> the speaker would have
said <i>to</i>ku taha. The <i>nei</i> however attracts the <i>te</i>,
and thus resolves <i>toku</i> into its component parts.</p>

<p>15. <i>He</i> differs in its uses from <i>te tahi</i> and <i>e tahi</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>He</i>, of itself, often implies the verb substantive.
(Vid. rule 3).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>He</i> is very seldom found after a preposition. It is
almost always found in the nominative case after the substantive verb;
e.&nbsp;g., he tangata tenei; he kino kau koutou.</p>

<p class="small">Thus it would not be correct to say, I kainga, e
<i>he</i> kuri, it was eaten by a dog; hei tiki i <i>he</i> rakau,
<i>to fetch a stick</i>. It should be e <i>te</i> kuri, i <i>te
tahi</i> rakau.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;<i>He</i> is
sometimes found after <i>ma</i> and <i>na</i>, e.&nbsp;g., nana i
homai <i>he</i> paraikete i mahana ai au. We believe, however, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110">{110}</a></span>this
exception to rule (<i>b</i>) is only apparent, and that <i>he waka</i>, here, is
the nominative case. (Vid. <i>Verbs</i>.)</p>

<p>16. <i>A.</i> A strange use of <i>a</i> is sometimes met with in
Waikato. When two nouns follow each other in apposition, <i>a</i> is
sometimes prefixed to the latter; e.&nbsp;g., Ka noho atu tera i te kai
mana <i>a</i> te kahawai, <i>he indeed will remain away from the food
for him!&mdash;the kahawai!</i></p>

<p>E hoe ana ki Akarana, ki te kai mana <i>a</i> te paraoa, <i>he is
paddling to Auckland for food for himself&mdash;flour</i>.</p>

<p>Sometimes it occurs in sentences like the following, Na wai tenei
haere <i>a</i> te po? <i>Whose going is this</i>, (I mean,) <i>in the
night?</i> i.&nbsp;e., <i>who ever goes by night?</i></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A personal pronoun following the verb in the nominative
will very seldom take <i>a</i> before it; e.&nbsp;g., Whakangaromia iho
<i>ratou</i>. It would not be correct to say <i>a</i> ratou.</p>

<p class="small">To this rule there are a few exceptions, e.&nbsp;g.,
tu ana ratou, <i>a</i> ia tangata <i>a</i> ia tangata, <i>they stood
each man</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Proper names are not subject to the above rule; e.&nbsp;g., it
would not be correct to say, Whakangaromia iho <i>Ngatipaoa</i>. It
should be <i>a</i> Ngatipaoa.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) When a question is asked in reference to a preceding
remark, <i>a</i> will precede the pronoun, e.&nbsp;g., E ki na koe. <i>A</i>
wai? A koe ra, <i>You assert&mdash;who? You, forsooth</i>.</p>

<p>17. The articles, definite and indefinite, are always repeated in
Maori, as in French, before every substantive in the sentence; e.&nbsp;g.,
Ko <i>te</i> whakapono <i>te</i> take o <i>te</i> aroha, raua ko
<i>te</i> pai, <i>faith is the root of love, and good works</i>.</p>

<p>18. Adjectives used substantively require the article; e.&nbsp;g.,
<i>He</i> tika rawa <i>te</i> he ki a ia, <i>the wrong is perfectly
right in his opinion</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_111"
id="page_111">{111}</a></span>19. Frequently, also, the article is
prefixed to what would be a participle in English; e.&nbsp;g., Kei
<i>te noho</i>, <i>he is at the sitting</i>, i.&nbsp;e., <i>he is
sitting</i>; ka tata <i>te maoa</i>, <i>the being cooked is
near</i>.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;It is,
however, probable that all such words as noho, &amp;c., should, in
constructions like the above, be regarded as substantives. We shall
have to treat on this hereafter. (Vid. <i>Verbs</i>.)</p>

<h2><span class="fs80">CHAPTER XV.</span><br />SYNTAX OF THE NOUN.</h2>

<p>§ 1.&mdash;<i>Nouns in Apposition.</i>&mdash;These were partly
considered in the last chapter, and we now proceed to
offer further remarks respecting them:&mdash;</p>

<p>When one or more nouns follow another in apposition,
and are equally definite in meaning, the same
article that is prefixed to the first will be prefixed to
all the rest; e.&nbsp;g., <i>He</i> tangata kino koe, <i>he</i> tangata
kohuru, <i>you are a bad man, a murderer</i>; <i>ko</i> au tenei,
<i>ko</i> tou matua, <i>this is I, your father</i>; mau mai <i>taku</i>
pu, <i>tera</i> i roto i te whare, <i>bring here my gun, that in
the house</i>.</p>

<p class="small">The following sentences are erroneous:&mdash;Tenei
ahau, <i>ko</i> to koutou hoa, te mea nei, <i>this is I your friend,
who says</i>, &amp;c.; Tiakina to tatou kainga, <i>ko</i> Waikato,
<i>take care of our settlement, Waikato</i>; the <i>ko</i> should have
been omitted in the former sentence: instead of the <i>ko</i> in the
latter, we should have had <i>a</i>. Proper names, and pronouns, will
only take their proper articles; e.&nbsp;g., Nohea tenei Kingi
<i>a</i> Parao? <i>whence was this King Pharoah?</i></p>

<p class="small">N.B.&mdash;There are exceptions to these rules. Some
of them will be mentioned under the next head.</p>

<p>§ 2.&mdash;The preposition, which is prefixed to the first of two or more
nouns in apposition, will be prefixed to all the rest; e.&nbsp;g.,
<i>Naku</i> tenei pukapuka, <i>na</i> tou hoa, <i>na</i> Tarapipipi,
<i>this letter is mine</i>, (i.&nbsp;e., was written by me,) <i>your
friend's, Tarapipipi's</i>: kei nga Pakeha <i>ta</i> matou whakaaro,
<i>ta</i> nga tangata Maori, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_113"
id="page_113">{113}</a></span><i>with the Europeans are the sentiments
of us, of the New Zealanders</i>.</p>

<p>The same usage holds in the vocative case, <i>E</i> hoa,
<i>E</i> Hone, <i>Friend John</i>.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>The following examples will shew that this rule, which seems as yet
to have escaped the notice of foreigners, is worthy of attention; a ka
kite i a Hone <i>te</i> tamaiti a Hemi, <i>and he saw John, the son of
James</i>. The meaning of this, as it stands, is, <i>the son of James
saw John</i>. Kei a koutou, <i>nga</i> tangata Maori, <i>in the
opinion of you the New Zealanders</i>. This literally means, <i>the
New Zealanders are with you</i>. In the first of these two sentences
it should be, <i>i</i> te tamaiti, &amp;c., in the second, <i>kei</i>
nga tangata Maori. Again; kua kainga e koutou, te kura, <i>it was
eaten by you, the school</i>. The literal meaning of this is, <i>the
school have been eaten by you</i>. Kua kainga e koutou <i>ko</i> te
kura, <i>it has been eaten by you the school</i>. As it stands, it
means, <i>it has been eaten by you and the school</i>. Again, if we
were to say, "Na Ihowa to tatou Atua, nana hoki tatou i whakaora," we
should imply that <i>our God was made by Jehovah, and that it was he
who saved us</i>. It should be, Na <i>to tatou Atua</i>.</p>

<p>There are however occasional exceptions to this rule, which it will
often be useful to remember; (<i>a</i>) when brevity of diction is
desired both preposition and article will be sometimes omitted before
the second substantive; e.&nbsp;g., i rokohanga atu e ahau ki
<i>Mangere</i>, <i>kainga</i> o te Tawa, <i>(he) was overtaken by me
at Mangere, (the) settlement of Tawa</i>; i rongo ahau ki a Koiunuunu,
<i>hungawai</i> o Panaia, <i>I heard it from Koiunuunu (the)
father-in-law of Panaia</i>; na te Riutoto, <i>whaea</i> o Paratene,
<i>it belongs to Riutoto (the) mother of Broughton</i>. When a pause,
also, is made between the two substantives, the preposition will be
<i>sometimes</i> omitted before the second; e.&nbsp;g., kei te kainga o te
Wherowhero, <i>te</i> rangatira o Waikato, <i>at the Settlement of
Wherowhoro, the Chief of Waikato</i>. E pa, kua kite ahau i a
koe&mdash;<i>to</i> mamingatanga hoki ki a au! <i>Friend, I have found
you out, your bamboozling of me forsooth.</i></p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;This distinction is very similar to that which obtains
in English for the regulating of the sign of the possessive case. In
such sentences, for example, as the following, "for David, my
servant's sake," we should always have the sign of the possessive
annexed to the latter noun; because it follows the preceding one in
close and unbroken succession. In the following however&mdash;"This is
Paul's advice, the Christian Hero, and great Apostle of the Gentiles,"
the sign of the possessive is omitted; because the connexion between
<i>Paul and hero</i>, is not so immediate as in the preceding example.
So, also, in Maori; when the latter noun <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_114" id="page_114">{114}</a></span>follows in a complementary
clause, as descriptive, or explanatory of the former, and has thus a
pause, or comma, intervening, it may <i>occasionally</i> dispense with the
preposition by which the former noun is preceded.</p>

</div>

<p>§ 3. And we may here state, that clauses in <i>epanorthosis</i> will
frequently reject those rules of government which they, under other
circumstances, would have recognised; and that they will often rather
partake of the nature of an exclamation, (vid. chapter 14, § 10,
<i>note</i>.) Thus in the example just adduced, <i>to mamingatanga</i>
is not in the objective case, as is <i>koe</i> in the clause
preceding. It would appear that after the speaker had said, <i>Kua
kite ahau i a koe</i>, he recollected himself, and exclaimed, in
explanation,&mdash;<i>to mamingatanga hoki</i>. In a leisurely constructed
sentence he would most probably have said, "<i>Kua kite ahau i a
koe</i>, i <i>to</i>," &amp;c. Again, in the first example of
<i>epanorthosis</i> (page 104), <i>Ka tae te hohoro o ta tatou kai, te
pau!</i> a native would not say, <i>o te pau</i>, as strict grammar
requires; but rather puts <i>te pau</i> in the form of an exclamation.</p>

<p>§ 4. The answer to a question will always, in its construction,
correspond to the question; e.&nbsp;g., <i>Na</i> wai i tango? <i>Na</i>
Hone, <i>Who took it? John</i>. <i>I</i> a wai taku pu? <i>I</i> a
Hone, <i>With whom was my gun? with John</i>.</p>

<p>§ 5. There is no form in Maori corresponding to that contained in the
following expressions, "Land of Egypt," "River Euphrates." To
translate these by "Whenua <i>o</i> Ihipa," &amp;c., would be to represent
Egypt, and Euphrates, as individuals possessing that land, and that
river. To render them by apposition would we fear not much improve our
Maori diction; (though it would certainly be more in accordance with
Maori analogy.) Here, therefore, necessity must make a law for
herself, and recognize the former mode of construction as legitimate.
At the same time, it is desirable that it should be adopted as seldom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_115" id="page_115">{115}</a></span>as
possible. Thus, in the following: "Mount Horeb," "Mount Sinai,"
&amp;c., we should approve of "Mount" being rendered as a proper name,
to which it closely approximates in English, and for which we think we
may claim the permission of the original. We therefore approve of
those phrases being rendered, "Maunga Horepa," "Maunga Oriwa," &amp;c.
Lastly; such forms as "the book of Genesis," &amp;c., should never we
think, be rendered by te pukapuka o Kenehi, &amp;c.; for a native
will, thereby, be led to believe that Genesis wrote the book. The
difficulty, however, may be here easily obviated: for <i>book</i> may be
altogether omitted, and "ko Kenehi" simply employed&mdash;a form, by
the way, which is adopted by the Septuagint.</p>

<p>§ 6. <i>The possessive case.</i>&mdash;This case is much used in Maori. It
is employed often to denote intensity; e.&nbsp;g., Ko <i>to</i>
Ngatimaniapoto tangata nui ha ia! <i>Oh, he is Ngatimaniapoto's great
man</i>; i.&nbsp;e., <i>he is a very great man in that tribe</i>.</p>

<p>It will, also, in some instances supersede the nominative or objective
of the person; e.&nbsp;g., the following sentence is erroneous: kihai ahau i
pai kia whakakahoretia ia, <i>I was not willing to refuse him</i>;
this as it stands, means <i>to despise or make a cipher of</i>. It
should have been, kia whakakahoretia <i>tana</i>; negative <i>his</i>.
(request sub.)</p>

<p>§ 7. It is sometimes useful for denoting the time from which an action
has commenced; e.&nbsp;g., kahore i kai, <i>o</i> to matou uranga mai ano,
<i>we have not eaten</i> since <i>we landed</i>; Moe rawa atu ki
Waitoke. Te haerenga atu <i>o</i> hea? <i>We slept at Waitoke. From
what place did you start?</i> Te taenga mai o Hone, kihai i rongo. Te
tononga iho <i>o</i> te ata, <i>when John came here we would not
listen to him; (though) he continued to ask</i> from <i>the break of
day</i>.</p>

<p><i>The possessive form is often used in predication; vid. syntax of
verbs.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116"
id="page_116">{116}</a></span>§ 8. Often the possessive preposition is
used where, in English, a different one would be employed; e.&nbsp;g.,
<i>no</i> Otahuhu tenei ara, <i>this path (leads) to Otahuhu</i>;
kahore he wai <i>o</i> roto, <i>there is no water in it</i>. Ka kainga
e to matua tane te roi <i>o</i> te tuatanga<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_36" id="R_36" href="#F_36">[36]</a></span> ki te kainga tapu.
Apopo ake ka kainga e te Ariki te roi o tana tamaiti, <i>the fern
root</i> <span class="smcap">of the tuatanga</span> <i>is eaten by the
father. Next day the fern</i> <span class="smcap">of his child</span>
<i>is eaten by the Ariki (head chief)</i>.</p>

<p>§ 9. A word in the possessive case occurring with another twice
repeated, will generally follow after the first of such words; e.&nbsp;g.,
ki te tahi taha <i>ona</i>, ki te tahi taha, <i>at either side of
him</i>; lit. <i>at one side of him, at one side</i>. Sometimes other
words will be found to intervene between the possessive case and the
word that governs it: e.&nbsp;g., ko nga tangata <i>katoa tenei o</i>
Waimate,&mdash;<i>here are all the men of Waimate</i>.</p>

<p>§ 10. The word by which a possessive case is governed, is often not
expressed in Maori; e.&nbsp;g., ka tokowha <i>o</i> matou ka mate, <i>four
of us have died</i>; e wha nga rau o te kupenga a Hone, <i>there were
four hundred</i> (<i>fishes</i> sub.) <i>of the net of John</i>; kei
hea to Hone?&mdash;<i>where is John's?</i> (garment sub.)</p>

<p>§ 11. In the northern part of this island when a noun is placed in
immediate connexion with such pronouns as <i>noku, moku, &amp;c.</i>, it
will sometimes omit the article before it; e.&nbsp;g., no ratou <i>Atua</i>
a Ihowa, <i>whose God is the Lord</i>; ka meinga mona <i>wahi</i>,
appoint <i>him a portion</i>.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This form is
rare in Waikato.</p>

<p>§ 12. When two substantives meet together, one of which denotes the
material of which the other consists, or some quality belonging to it,
the word denoting the material, quality, &amp;c., will simply follow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117" id="page_117">{117}</a></span>the
other as part of a compound word; e.&nbsp;g., he whare <i>papa</i>, <i>a</i>
board <i>house</i>; ika <i>moana</i>, <i>a sea fish</i>; he repo
<i>hurakeke</i>, <i>a flax swamp</i>; he oranga <i>patunga</i>, <i>the
survivors from a slaughter</i>; he tangata <i>kupu rau</i>, <i>a man of a
hundred words</i>; i.&nbsp;e., a deceitful person.</p>

<p>§ 13. Not unfrequently, when some circumstance or quality, is
attributed to a person, it will be simply affirmed to be him; e.&nbsp;g., He
<i>uaua kiore koe</i>, <i>you are a rat's strength</i>; <i>he taringa
whiti rua (or tua,)</i> koe, <i>you are an</i> erring <i>ear</i>;
i.&nbsp;e., <i>one who does not hear correctly</i>; he kaone tenei,
<i>this</i> (heap of potatoes) <i>is a gown</i>; i.&nbsp;e., to purchase a
gown; he aha koe? <i>what are you?</i> (i.&nbsp;e., what are you come for?)
Ko <i>au</i> ra ko <i>ia</i>, <i>I am he</i>; i.&nbsp;e., he and I are of
the same mind, &amp;c.; ko taku iwituaroa tena, <i>that is my
backbone</i>; (a form for making a thing sacred.)</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This mode of
predication seems to have been much in use amongst the Hebrews; vid.
Gen. 41, 26. The seven good kine (are) seven years, and chap. 46, 34,
"Every shepherd is an abomination;" "That rock was Christ;" "This is
my body;" "Ye were once darkness," &amp;c.</p>

<p>§ 14. Another particular, also, in which Maori will be found to
resemble Hebrew is, the frequent substitution of the substantive for
the adjective. Thus, we frequently hear, <i>he kakakore</i> koe, you
are weakness; <i>he kino</i> te rangi nei, the sky is badness, &amp;c.,
neither must the student imagine as have some in the interpretation of
the Scriptures, that this mode of construction is always emphatic.</p>

<p>§ 15. The objective case almost always follows the verb;
e.&nbsp;g., ka ngau <i>i a au</i>, <i>he will bite me</i>; except
sometimes in sentences in which <i>na</i>, <i>ma</i>, &amp;c. are
used; e.&nbsp;g., <i>nana</i> ahau i tiki ake, <i>he fetched me</i>;
<i>noku</i> ka mate.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This form will
be considered hereafter, (vid. <i>Verbs</i>).</p>

<p>Sometimes a noun, which is plural in meaning, will take the form of
the singular; e.&nbsp;g., ko nga tamariki <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_118" id="page_118">{118}</a></span>a Kaihau hei <i>tamaiti</i>
ki a te Katipa, <i>the</i> children <i>of Kaihau are a</i> child <i>to Katipa</i>;
i.&nbsp;e., stand in the relation of children.</p>

<p>§ 16. <i>Compound Words.</i>&mdash;A word in connection with a compound
word will often be governed by one of the simples of which the latter
consists; e.&nbsp;g. Kai atawhai <i>i a koe</i>; <i>one to take care of
you</i>; <i>koe</i> here is governed by <i>atawhai</i>; ki te whenua
kai mau, <i>to the land of food for you</i>; <i>mau</i>, here is
influenced by <i>kai</i>.</p>

<p>§ 17. A verb can always be changed into a personal agent by prefixing
<i>kai</i>; e.&nbsp;g., tiaki ia, <i>to guard</i>; kai tiaki ia, <i>a
guard</i>.</p>

<p>§ 18. On the prefixing and omitting of the article <i>te</i> to
<i>proper names</i>;</p>

<p>To lay down any exact rules respecting this subject is, we fear,
impossible: neither, indeed, is it very necessary; as genuine Maori
names are being fast exchanged for those of foreigners. There are,
however, a few particulars which deserve notice. (a) A simple
substantive, adopted as a proper name, may, or may not have <i>te</i>
prefixed; chiefly as caprice regulates; (b) If, however, the noun be
in the plural number <i>te</i> is never prefixed; e.&nbsp;g. Ngakainga; (c)
A verb and words compounded of verbs, will generally omit it. e.&nbsp;g.
Tangi: (d) Numerals, as far as <i>ten</i>, will generally take it: (e)
The proper names which omit <i>te</i> will be found perhaps to be
nearly double in number those which take it.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The prefixes
<i>rangi</i> and <i>ngati</i> belong chiefly, the former to the names
of females, the latter to the names of tribes.</p>

<p>On the distinction between <i>o</i> and <i>a</i>;</p>

<p>§ 19. This very useful feature of Maori does not seem to be clearly
recognized in some parts of New Zealand. It obtains, however, in the
other islands of these seas, and may be satisfactorily shewn, even now
to exist in those parts of this island in which it would be least
expected: for example; all will admit that <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_119" id="page_119">{119}</a></span><i>na</i>ku i patu,
<i>mine was the having struck</i>; i.&nbsp;e., <i>I struck (him)</i>,
is different from <i>no</i>ku i patu; <i>because I struck him</i>; and
that <i>ma</i> te aha? will signify, <i>by what means?</i> and <i>mo</i>
te aha? <i>for what reason?</i></p>

<p>The words in which distinction obtains are <i>mo</i> and <i>ma</i>,
<i>no</i> and <i>na</i>, <i>o</i> and <i>a</i>, and their compounds,
<i>mona</i> and <i>mana</i>, <i>nona</i> and <i>nana</i>, <i>toku</i>
and <i>taku</i>: the first and leading distinction between these two
forms is (a) that <i>o</i> implies a passive meaning, <i>a</i>
an active. Thus, he patu <i>moku</i> is, <i>a striking for me</i>,
i.&nbsp;e., for me to suffer; he patu <i>maku</i> is <i>an instrument for me
to strike with</i>, (b) <i>o</i> also implies the inherency,
and propriety of a quality or thing, as well as the time and moral
cause of an action.</p>

<p>Hence it will, almost always, be prefixed to the members of the body,
to land enjoyed by inheritance, to sickness, the productions of
nature, such as fruits, &amp;c., &amp;c. Thus, we seldom hear, &#257;ku
ringaringa; n&#257;ku tena oneone; he mate n&#257;ku; <i>o</i> is almost
always employed. Again, we always hear, <i>noku</i> i haere mai nei,
<i>since I came here</i>; <i>mou</i> i tutu, <i>because you were
disobedient</i>; <i>nona</i> te he, <i>his was the error</i>.</p>

<p>(c.) <i>O</i> is always employed in talking of garments and houses,
which are in wear, use, &amp;c. Thus, <i>naku</i> tena whare means, <i>I
built that house</i>, Noku, &amp;c., <i>I dwell in it</i>.</p>

<p>§ 20. <i>A</i> is prefixed to the <i>agent</i>, and implies that the
noun, which is connected with that agent, is either an act of it, or
an instrument with which, or sometimes a thing upon which the action
is performed, such as tools, cultivations, food, <i>words</i>, &amp;c.,
(as <i>kupu</i>, <i>korero</i>; because they are fashioned by the
tongue); e.&nbsp;g., <i>taku</i> toki; <i>naku</i> tena mara, <i>maku</i> te
kupu ki mua; kai <i>mau</i>.</p>

<p>§ 21. When the action is intransitive, <i>o</i> is generally employed;
e.&nbsp;g. te toronga atu <i>o</i> te ringa o Hone; <i>to</i>ku haerenga. To
this rule, however, there are many exceptions.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_120"
id="page_120">{120}</a></span><span
class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Visitors, slaves, or servants,
children; (i.&nbsp;e. own children; or children of whom the individual
has the management), husband, (tane), wife, (wahine), will take the
<i>a</i>; when, however, <i>hoa</i>, <i>ariki</i>, <i>rangatira</i>,
<i>matua</i>, <i>whanaunga</i>, are used, <i>o</i> will be prefixed.
<i>Reo</i> also will take <i>o</i>; (the voice, being a part of the
man). Oranga, also though it applies to food, will take <i>o</i> after
it; e.&nbsp;g. kai hei oranga <i>mo</i> matou, <i>food to support
us</i>. In the following passage "n<i>o</i>na te whiunga i mau ai to
tatou rongo," <i>the chastisement of our peace was upon him</i>, the
<i>o</i> in the <i>nona</i> has, we think, supplied a more concise and
clear rendering than could have been attained without it.&mdash;If it
had been, "N<i>a</i>na te whiunga, &amp;c.," we should have understood
that it was he who <i>inflicted</i>, instead of <i>suffered</i> the
chastisement. It should be remembered that there are two
pronunciations of <i>taku</i>, and <i>tana</i>; viz., t&#259;ku, and
t&#257;ku, t&#259;na, and t&#257;na; the short <i>a</i> corresponds to
the <i>o</i>; the long <i>a</i> to the <i>a</i> of <i>ma</i> and
<i>na</i>. Of tou, <i>yours</i>, there are also two pronunciations;
viz., <i>tou</i>, and <i>to</i>, the former corresponds to the
<i>o</i> of <i>mona</i>; the latter sometimes to the <i>a</i> of
<i>mana</i>.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The <i>to</i>
is very frequently used instead of the <i>tou</i>&mdash;chiefly in
those parts of the sentence in which euphony requires that the sound
should not be prolonged.</p>

<p>The importance of attending to these distinctions between the <i>o</i>
and the <i>a</i> may be shewn by a few examples; he hangi <i>mau</i>,
is <i>an oven with which you may cook food</i>; he hangi <i>mou</i>,
is <i>an oven in which you are to be cooked</i>, and would be a most
offensive curse; he taua <i>maku</i> is a party with which I may
attack another; he taua <i>moku</i>, is <i>a party come to attack
me</i>; te ngutu <i>o</i> Hone, is <i>John's lip</i>; te ngutu
<i>a</i> Hone is his <i>word</i>, or <i>report</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<h2><span class="fs80">CHAPTER XVI.</span><br />SYNTAX OF THE ADJECTIVES.</h2>

<p>§ 1. Adjectives generally follow substantives; e.&nbsp;g., he tangata
kohuru, <i>a murderer</i>. Sometimes, however, they will take the form
of an adverb, and precede; e.&nbsp;g., homai <i>katoa</i> mai nga mea,
<i>give (me) all the things</i>. Sometimes, also, they will take the
form of a verb and precede; e.&nbsp;g., <i>nui rawa</i> taku riri, <i>very
great is my anger</i>&mdash;or of a substantive; e.&nbsp;g., he <i>nui</i> taku
riri, idem.</p>

<p>§ 2. The pronominal adjectives, <i>tenei</i>, &amp;c., and <i>taua</i>
will always precede; e.&nbsp;g., <i>tena</i> mea.</p>

<p>§ 3. Adjectives will generally take the form of the noun with which
they are connected; i.&nbsp;e., if the noun be of the verbal form, so also
will be the adjective; e.&nbsp;g., oranga tonutanga, <i>eternal life</i>;
rerenga pukutanga, <i>sailing hungry</i>.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;To this rule
there are many exceptions. Thus, we have kainga <i>kotahi</i>, <i>one
eating</i>; i.&nbsp;e., <i>one meal</i>; matenga nui, patunga tapu,
whakamutunga pai, tikinga hangarau, korerotanga tuatahi. In many cases
observation can alone determine when such forms are admissible. As a
general rule, it would perhaps be correct to say that when the verbal
noun is of very familiar use, so as almost to have its verbal
character forgotten, or when some <i>thing</i> or <i>single</i> act,
is spoken of, it will sometimes admit after it an adjective of the
simple form. It will, we think, also be found that such common
adjectives as nui, pai, katoa, and also the numerals most frequently
follow in the simple form.</p>

<p>§ 4. Under other circumstances, the adjective will follow in the
verbal form, especially when diversity <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_122"
id="page_122">{122}</a></span>or a number of acts of the same kind, is
intended. Thus, oku nohoanga katoa will mean <i>all my
settlements</i>; aku nohoanga katoatanga, <i>all the times in which I
sit down</i>. The following expressions are objectionable: korerotanga
whakamut<i>u</i>, tirohanga ata<i>whai</i>, whakinga puk<i>u</i>.</p>

<p>§ 5. It should be noticed, perhaps, here, that we sometimes find the
verbal noun used as an adjective or participle, and with a passive
meaning: e.&nbsp;g., he toki tua, is <i>an axe to fell with</i>; he toki
<i>tuakanga</i>, <i>an axe which has been used in felling</i>; he mea
<i>whakakakuranga</i> mai no tawahi, (clothes) <i>worn abroad and sent
here</i>. Whakakahu would in this construction be seldom used. On the
other hand we meet with pu whakamoe; <i>gun taken to bed with you</i>;
poaka whangai, <i>fed pig</i>.</p>

<p>§ 6. <i>Many adjectives to one substantive.</i>&mdash;It is contrary to the
genius of Maori to allow many adjectives to follow one substantive.
When, therefore, it is desired to affirm many qualities of the same
word, the word itself will be repeated before each adjective; e.&nbsp;g.,
<i>a great and good man</i>, would be thus rendered: he <i>tangata</i>
nui, he <i>tangata</i> pai; or the adjectives will be converted into
substantives, by taking the article <i>he</i> before them. Thus, the
above sentence might be rendered: <i>he nui, he pai</i> tena tangata,
<i>he was a great</i>, &amp;c.; a large red blanket might be thus
rendered: he paraikete nui, he <i>mea</i> whero. Sometimes the
adjective will be resolved into the verb; "a great and terrible God,"
would be thus rendered; he Atua nui, <i>e wehingia ana</i>.</p>

<p>§. 7. The following are instances in which an adjective is made to
qualify two substantives: ko te poaka raua ko te paraoa, <i>he reka
kau</i>, <i>pork and flour (they are both) sweet, or (a
sweetness)</i>; he mea reka te poaka, he me reka te paraoa, idem. Tena
koa etahi hate, etahi tarau hoki, <i>kei nga mea pai</i>: <i>Shew
some</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123">{123}</a></span>
<i>shirts and some trousers; let them be good ones</i>: <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, <i>shew
some good shirts, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>§ 8. Sometimes the adjective will unexpectedly assume the form of a
verb or substantive, e.&nbsp;g., kei ona kainga, <i>e</i> (or <i>he</i>,)
maha, <i>he is at his many settlements</i>. The following form is
heard at Taranaki: kia toru <i>he</i> ra, <i>it will take three
days</i>. Sometimes adverbs are used as adjectives; e.&nbsp;g., he tohunga
<i>rawa</i>, <i>a great artist, &amp;c.</i>, te <i>tino</i> tangata,
<i>the very individual</i>. The following form in which the verb
supplies the place of the adjective, is, we believe, in general use: a
pouri ana o matou ngakau mo tenei patunga o matou <i>ka rua</i>;
<i>our hearts are dark at this second murder of our friends, lit.,
this murder of our friends, it is two</i>.</p>

<p><i>Comparison of adjectives.</i>&mdash;The comparative degree is denoted in
various ways in Maori. (a) The first, and most common, is similar to
that adopted in Hebrew; viz. by putting the preposition <i>i</i>
(<i>from</i>) after the adjective; e.&nbsp;g., e kaha ana a Hone <i>i</i> a
Pita, <i>John is stronger than Peter</i>. (b) Sometimes there is
joined to the adjective some adverb of intensity; e.&nbsp;g., e kaha
<i>rawa</i> ana a Hone <i>i</i> a Pita, <i>John is much stronger,
&amp;c.</i> (c) Sometimes it is denoted by the adjectives ngari, and
rangi, the verb following in epanorthosis; e.&nbsp;g., e ngari a Hone i a
Pita, <i>e kaha ana</i>.</p>

<p>(d.) Sometimes the comparative is denoted by some approbatory, and the
positive by some disapprobatory term; e.&nbsp;g., e <i>pai</i> ana tenei
paraikete, e <i>kino</i> ana tera, <i>this blanket is good, that is
bad</i>. (e.) Sometimes the positive is put into the negative form,
and the comparative into the affirmative; e.&nbsp;g., e ngari ano te patu i
a au; aua e tangohia oratia taku kainga, <i>it is better to kill me,
do not take away my settlement while I live</i>; i.&nbsp;e., I should rather
die than have my possessions taken from me. E nui ana taku hara, e
kore e taea te muru, <i>my sin is greater than that it can be
pardoned</i>; lit. my sin is great, it cannot be pardoned. He
<i>hira</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124"
id="page_124">{124}</a></span>te hunga i a koe nei; <i>e kore</i> e ho
atu e ahau nga Miriani ki a ratou, <i>the people that are with thee
are too many for me to give the Midianites into their power</i>.</p>

<p>(f.) Sometimes the positive is made antecedent, and the comparative
consequent; e.&nbsp;g., me patu ano au ka riro ai toku kainga, <i>you must
kill me, and</i> <span class="smcap">then</span> <i>take my possessions</i>.</p>

<p>(g.) Following, are two modes of comparison which are sometimes met
with: <i>poka ke atu</i> te pai o te ra tahi <i>i</i> ou whare i nga
ra ko tahi mano, <i>one day in thy courts is better than a
thousand</i>. Ma tenei e whakakoakoa ai a Ihowa <i>tera atu</i> i te
koakoatanga ki te okiha, <i>this shall please the Lord better than an
ox</i>.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;These two
forms are not much used in Waikato. The following is sometimes heard,
but it is a weak mode of comparison: <i>rere ke</i> ana te pai o tenei
<i>i</i> tera, <i>the goodness of this is different from that</i>.</p>

<p>(h.) A very common process for denoting an <i>inferiority of
degree</i>, is to associate two contrary qualities: e.&nbsp;g., pai kino,
<i>indifferently good</i>; roa poto, (long short,) <i>of moderate
length</i>; mangu ma nei, (black white,) <i>blackish</i>.</p>

<p>(i.) The adverb <i>tua</i> prefixed to the adjective denotes a similar
kind of comparison: e.&nbsp;g., <i>tua</i> riri, <i>somewhat angry</i>;
<i>tua</i> pouri, <i>rather dark</i>. (k.) Sometimes comparison is
implied by reduplication of one or more syllables: e.&nbsp;g.,
pouri<i>uri</i>, <i>darkish</i> (as in twilight). All adjectives
which, in English, are preceded by some qualifying adverb: as
<i>somewhat</i>, <i>not very</i>, <i>moderately</i>, <i>as it
were</i>, &amp;c., can be rendered into Maori by one, or other, of these
three last methods.</p>

<p><i>The Superlative degree.</i> Maori has no direct form to mark the
superlative, but expresses it by various circumlocutions: (a.) by the
definite article prefixed, with, or without some word of intensity:
e.&nbsp;g., Ko au <i>te</i> kaumatua, <i>I am the eldest son</i>; ko <i>te
tino</i> nohinohi <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_125"
id="page_125">{125}</a></span>rawa tena, <i>that is the least</i>; ko
te nui tenei o nga rakau <i>katoa</i>, <i>this is the largest</i>
(lit. <i>the</i> large one) <i>of all the trees</i>. (b.) The form for
the comparative sometimes necessarily implies the sense of the
superlative: e.&nbsp;g., he <i>tino</i> mohio ia <i>i</i> nga tangata
katoa, <i>he is the most wise of all men</i>.</p>

<p>(c.) Following are two other forms for denoting the superlative: e.&nbsp;g.,
e ngari a Hone e mohio ana; a, <i>waiho ano i</i> a Wiremu te tino
mohio, <i>John is better, he understands; but leave the great
knowledge</i> with <i>William</i>; or, whakarerea rawatia i a Wiremu,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Sometimes a great degree of intensity is denoted by a repetition of
the adjective, with a peculiarly prolonged sound of the first
syllable; e.&nbsp;g., n&#363;i, nui whakaharahara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126">{126}</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="fs80">CHAPTER XVII.</span><br />SYNTAX OF THE NUMERALS.</h2>

<p><i>The particles prefixed to numbers.</i></p>

<p><i>Ko.</i> § 1. This word will often, without <i>te</i>, precede
<i>tahi</i>; e.&nbsp;g., toku <i>ko tahi</i>, <i>myself alone</i>; kia <i>ko
tahi</i>, <i>be one</i>; i.&nbsp;e., pull together. When tahi is used as a
substantive, it will generally take <i>te</i>; e.&nbsp;g., ko <i>te tahi</i>
tenei, <i>this is one</i> (of them).</p>

<p>§ 2. The numerals between <i>one</i> and a <i>hundred</i> will seldom
take any article; but <i>rau</i> and <i>mano</i> will take either
<i>te</i> or <i>he</i>; e.&nbsp;g., <i>he</i> rau pea, <i>it is perhaps a
hundred</i>; ko tahi <i>te</i> rau, or <i>te</i> mano. Sometimes the
numerals lower than a 100 will take the article <i>te</i>, when the
substantive is not expressed but understood; e.&nbsp;g., e taea e <i>te
tekau</i> te whakanehenehe ki <i>te hokorima</i>? <i>can the ten
contend with the fifty?</i></p>

<p>§ 3. The simple numeral is mostly used in counting; e.&nbsp;g., tahi, rua,
toru, one, two, three, &amp;c. Often, however, the verbal particle
<i>ka</i> is used in the same sense; ka tahi, ka rua, &amp;c., it is one,
there are two, &amp;c.</p>

<p>§ 4. <i>Ka</i>, prefixed to the numeral, generally denotes the
<i>completion</i> of a number; e.&nbsp;g., <i>ka</i> toru enei matenga oku i
a koe, <i>this is the third time I have been ill treated by you</i>,
i.&nbsp;e., this makes up the third, &amp;c.</p>

<p>§ 5. <i>E</i> is a very frequent prefix of the numbers between
<i>one</i> and <i>ten</i>. It differs from <i>ka</i> in that it does
not so distinctly imply the <i>completion</i> of, or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_127"
id="page_127">{127}</a></span><i>arriving at</i>, a number, and that
whereas <i>ka</i> will generally answer to the question, "How many
have you counted, made, &amp;c., <i>e</i> will be used in reply to
"How many are there"? e.&nbsp;g., <i>e</i> hia ena kete? How many
baskets are those? It would not however be generally correct to say,
<i>E</i> hia ena kete <i>ka</i> oti? It should be <i>ka hia</i>.
Again, ahea koe hoki mai ai? <i>Ka</i> rua aku wiki. <i>When will you
return? in two weeks' time.</i> It should be <i>kia</i> rua nga wiki.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This
distinction, however, does not hold invariably, &amp;c.</p>

<p>§ 6. <i>Kia.</i>&mdash;For its uses <i>vide verbal particles</i>.</p>

<p>§ 7. <span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The particles <i>i</i>
and <i>kua</i> are occasionally found prefixed to the numerals.
(<i>Vide those particles</i>, <span class="smcap">verbs</span>.)</p>

<p>§ 8. <i>The case and number following the numeral.</i> In most
instances, up to <i>one hundred</i>, the numeral will require no
possessive case after it; e.&nbsp;g., a, ho mai ana e ratou, e ono nga kete,
<i>and they gave six baskets</i>; lit. they were given by them, they
were, (or are), six baskets.</p>

<p>§ 9. Beyond <i>one hundred</i>, however, a possessive case is very
frequently employed; e.&nbsp;g., ko tahi mano <i>o</i> nga tau, one thousand
years.</p>

<p>§ 10. When the noun is in the oblique case, the numeral will generally
<i>follow</i> it; e.&nbsp;g., hei tapiri mo enei kete <i>e wha</i>, <i>as an
addition to these four baskets</i>. When it is in the nominative the
numeral will most frequently precede; e.&nbsp;g., <i>e wha</i> nga kete,
<i>there were four baskets</i>.</p>

<p>§ 11. It will be noticed that <i>tahi</i> is sometimes postfixed to
other numerals, and adjectives, without any variation of meaning;
e.&nbsp;g., e rima <i>tahi</i>, five, turituri <i>tahi</i>, <i>what a noise
(you are making)</i>. <i>Tahi</i> will sometimes take a plural after
it; ko tahi <i>ona</i> hoa, <i>one were his companions</i>; i.&nbsp;e., he
had one companion.</p>

<p>§ 12. Sometimes, when it is desired emphatically to denote all the
individuals, or items contained in a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_128"
id="page_128">{128}</a></span>certain number, the number will be
repeated; e.&nbsp;g., hokorima <i>hokorima iho</i>, <i>fifty fifty
down</i>; i.&nbsp;e., the <i>whole</i> fifty were killed; e wha, wha
mai ano, <i>four four to me</i>; bring the whole four. In one
instance, (viz., that of rua,) we have the first syllable reduplicated
to denote <i>both</i>; e.&nbsp;g., e tika <i>rurua</i> ana ano,
<i>they are both right</i>.</p>

<p>§ 13. Sometimes, in Waikato, we meet with an ironical use of numerals,
corresponding to that in English, "six of one, and half a dozen of the
other"; e.&nbsp;g., e whitu waru atu! they are seven eight other; e ngari a
Hone, e pai ana&mdash;<i>e wha atu</i> i a Pita! <i>he is four besides
Peter</i>; i.&nbsp;e., he is not better than Peter.</p>

<p>§ 14. <i>On the Ordinals.</i>&mdash;The student has seen (page 26) the
three ways in which these may be formed.</p>

<p>§ 15. There are, however, some distinctions between <i>tua</i> and
<i>whaka</i>, as prefixes, which deserve to be noticed. (1.) <i>Tua</i>
is not frequently found prefixed to numerals beyond <i>ten</i>. (2.) Occasionally,
also, a critical inquirer will, we think, detect a difference in the meaning
of the two particles. <i>Tua</i> seems to denote the place, a thing,
&amp;c., occupies in a series or gradation; <i>whaka</i>, a fraction which,
being added, makes the integer. Thus, in announcing a text, we might
say "Kei te ono o nga upoko, kei te <i>tuawha</i> o nga rarangi," <i>it is in
the sixth chapter and fourth verse</i>. We could not however, say Kei te
<i>whakawha o</i>, &amp;c. Again, a Native will say, Ko te <i>tua</i>hia tenei o
nga whakatupuranga ka tae iho ki a koe? Ko te tekau, <i>What number of
generations is this that reaches down to you?</i> answer, <i>the tenth</i>.
Here the generations are represented as following in a regular
succession to the tenth. If the reply were "Ko te <i>whaka</i>tekau tenei,"
we should understand that it is one, which added to the other nine,
will <i>make it ten</i>&mdash;a mode of expression which is sometimes
substituted <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_129"
id="page_129">{129}</a></span>for the following, "ko te whakakapi
tenei o te tekau," <i>this is one which fills up the place of the
tenth</i>. The word whakapu is often also used either to denote a
tally, (or surplus one), or the one which completes the number; hei
<i>whakapu</i> tenei mo aku riwai, <i>this is a tally for; (or this
completes the full number of) my potatoes</i>.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;In speaking of
a tenth, or tithe, of property, we should prefer <i>whakatekau</i> to
<i>tuatekau</i>; the former being a <i>fractional</i> tenth, the
latter an <i>ordinal</i>.</p>

<h2><span class="fs80">CHAPTER XVIII.</span><br />SYNTAX OF THE PRONOUNS.</h2>

<p>§ 1. The personal pronouns follow the verb; e.&nbsp;g., e mea ana
<i>ahau</i>.</p>

<p>§ 2. They are often also omitted after it; e.&nbsp;g., Ka tukua atu te
purahorua, ka tae ki te pa, korerotia atu, Kia mohio i te taua e haere
mai nei&mdash;&mdash;na ka te whai e te pa. Na wai i haere, a; ka tae ki nga
whakatakoto; ka pau te huaki, ka tangi te patu, ka whati tera, te pa;
<i>the messenger is sent</i> (he) <i>arrives at the pa</i> (it) <i>is
told</i> (them,) <i>be on</i> (your) <i>guard against the hostile
party</i> (which) <i>is approaching, so the pa then pursued</i>. <i>On
then</i> (they) <i>proceeded, till</i> (they) <i>came to the ambush,
the assault is made, the blow resounds, that flies, the pa</i>.
Sometimes, in Waikato, they are redundant; e.&nbsp;g., kei te kai taro
<i>mana</i>, <i>he is eating bread for himself</i>. Examples however
of this construction are not varied or frequent.</p>

<p>In Waikato the personal and possessive pronouns will frequently take
the particle <i>nge</i> before them, but without any variation of
meaning.</p>

<p>§ 3. It was observed (page 29) that there is no word in Maori to
denote the pronoun <i>it</i>. Occasionally, however, that word will be
designated by <i>ia</i> and its branches; e.&nbsp;g., waiho <i>mana</i> e
rapu atu te tahi huarahi <i>mona</i>, <i>let it (the axe,) search out
a path for itself</i>. This perhaps should be explained by
prosopop&#339;ia. Sometimes also we hear the following: te paraoa
<i>raua</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_131"
id="page_131">{131}</a></span>ko te poaka, <i>flour and pork</i>; nga
toki ki a <i>ratou</i> whakatoki, nga kakahu ki a <i>ratou</i>
whakakakahu, <i>axes by themselves, garments by themselves</i>.</p>

<p>§ 4. Often the singular and dual of the personal pronouns will be
employed to denote a whole tribe, or company; e.&nbsp;g., <i>naku</i> tena,
na te Urioteoro, <i>that is mine, the Urioteoro's</i>; i.&nbsp;e., the
property of my tribe. Keihea taua? <i>where are we two?</i> i.&nbsp;e.,
where is our party, ko ta <i>maua</i> ki tena, ta te tangata Maori,
<i>that is a phrase of us (two) of the New Zealander</i>, i.&nbsp;e., of the
New Zealanders.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This form is
often also used when the speaker wishes to propound some remark which
would appear harsh if too personal; e.&nbsp;g., he aha kei <i>a maua
ko Hone</i>, <i>what is with me and John</i>; i.&nbsp;e., oh, never
mind John: of what importance is he?</p>

<p class="small">Connected with this is a mode of phrase which we have
been surprised to hear questioned by some who claim a high character
as Maori scholars.</p>

<p>§ 5. A pronoun in the singular will often be made to refer to a
noun in the plural; ko nga tangata <i>tenei</i>, <i>nana</i> nga
tikaokao, <i>this are persons</i>, <span class="smcap">his</span>
<i>are the fowls</i>; nga tangata <i>nona</i> te kainga, <i>the
men</i> <span class="smcap">his</span> <i>is the settlement</i>,
i.&nbsp;e., whose is, &amp;c.; nga tangata <i>nana</i> i patu, <i>the
men</i> <span class="smcap">his</span> <i>was the having struck</i>;
i.&nbsp;e., who struck. <i>Tenei matou te</i> noho atu nei, <i>this is
we</i>, who <i>am sitting towards you</i>.</p>

<p>§ 6. It is a very common thing in Maori to put into the third person a
pronoun which has reference to either the first or second; e.&nbsp;g., hei
rama aha? <i>tana</i> koke noa atu,&mdash;<i>nana tana</i> rakau, <i>a
light for what purpose?</i>&mdash;<i>his</i> stumbling away&mdash;<i>his</i> is
<i>his</i> own <i>stick</i>, i.&nbsp;e., "What do I want of light?&mdash;I can
stumble out my way&mdash;I am accustomed to that kind of work;" ko te rangi
mahi kai tenei ma <i>tona</i> tinana, <i>this is the day for procuring
food for</i> his <i>body</i>; i.&nbsp;e., for ourselves; kei <i>tena</i>
tangata pea, <i>it rests perhaps with that individual</i>; i.&nbsp;e., with
you; <i>tona</i> tangata kaha ko koe, <i>you are his strong man</i>;
i.&nbsp;e., what a very strong man you <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_132"
id="page_132">{132}</a></span>are! (ironically); haere korua, e Hone,
<i>raua</i> ko Hemi, <i>go you (two) John, they two and James</i>;
i.&nbsp;e., go you and James.</p>

<p class="small">This last form is, perhaps, peculiar to the Waikato
District.</p>

<p>§ 7. When two or more individuals are connected in English by the
conjunction <i>and</i>, they will very frequently be denoted by the
dual or plural, of the personal pronoun of the more worthy person. For
example, <i>he</i> and <i>I</i> are denoted by <i>maua</i>, John and
James by Hone <i>raua</i> ko Hemi, John, James, and Luke, by Hone,
<i>ratou</i> ko Hemi, ko Ruka.</p>

<p class="small">In this construction the latter noun will be in the
nominative, even though the preceding be in an oblique case;
e.&nbsp;g., te atawhai o te Atua, <i>raua ko tana tamaiti, ko Ihu
Karaiti</i>, the mercy of God and His Son Jesus Christ. Here, though
<i>Atua</i> is in the possessive case, <i>raua</i> and tamaiti, and
Ihu Karaiti are in the nominative.</p>

<p class="small">This strange, though in Maori very common, mode of
construction cannot, we believe, be explained in any other way than by
an epanorthosis. (Vide page 114, § 3.)</p>

<p>§ 8. The noun belonging to the pronoun is often omitted, especially
in talking of garments; e.&nbsp;g., keihea toku? <i>Where is mine</i>;
i.&nbsp;e., my garment. Tikina atu te tahi ki a koe, <i>fetch some for
you</i>; i.&nbsp;e., fetch some garment. Ko wai toku?&mdash;<i>Who is
mine?</i>&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., my helper.</p>

<p>§ 9. <i>The relative pronouns.</i>&mdash;Following are some of the
ways in which the defect of the relative pronoun is supplied in
Maori:&mdash;(1) Te tangata <i>nana</i> nga kakano <i>the man whose
are the seeds</i>; (2) te tangata <i>i</i> nga kakano, <i>idem</i>;
(3) te tangata i patu <i>nei</i> i a Hone, the man (<i>who</i>) struck
John; <i>or</i> (4) te tangata i patua <i>ai</i> (<i>by whom, on
account of whom</i>), <i>he was beaten</i>; (5) Keihea, he poraka
<i>hei to</i> i te rakau? <i>Where is there a block (with which) to
drag the log?</i> (6) Keihea he haer<i>enga</i>? <i>where is there a
place on which (they, the cows) may run?</i> (7) Ko tenei <i>taku</i>
i mate nui <i>ai</i>, <i>this is</i> <span class="smcap">mine</span>
<i>desired</i>, i.&nbsp;e., this is <i>what</i> I wished for; (8) te
poaka i patua e koe, the <i>pig</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_133"
id="page_133">{133}</a></span><i>(which) was killed by you</i>; (9)
<i>kei reira</i> te pakaru, <i>kei reira</i> te paru, <i>you must
coat</i> (with raupo) <i>all parts of the house that are
broken</i>.</p>

<p>It will be seen in the preceding examples that the most common means
by which the want of the relative is supplied are by the preposition,
as in example 2; (2) by the particles <i>nei</i>, &amp;c., and <i>ai</i>,
as in examples 3 and 4; (3) by the verbal noun, as in examples 5 and
6; (4) by the possessive case with <i>ai</i>, as in example 7; (5) by
the passive voice, as in example 8. Occasionally, also, the personal
pronouns, as in example 1, or the adverb <i>reira</i>, as in example
9, &amp;c., are used for the same purpose.</p>

<p>§ 10. <i>Demonstrative Pronouns.</i>&mdash;(1) These, like the
primitive pronouns of Hebrew, are often used for the verb of
existence; (2) and the time will frequently be denoted by the pronoun
used; i.&nbsp;e., Tenei will mostly be used for the present tense;
tena, (and most frequently) tera, for the future, or past, and
sometimes for the imperative mood; e.&nbsp;g., e haere ana
<i>tenei</i> ahau, <span class="smcap">this</span> <i>I am going</i>;
i.&nbsp;e., I am going; <i>tenei</i> au, <i>here I am</i>; <i>tera</i>
e mate, <i>that will die</i>, i.&nbsp;e., he will die; <i>tena</i>
taku pu maua mai, <i>that my gun bring here</i>; i.&nbsp;e., bring my
gun.</p>

<p>The leading distinctions between tenei, tena, and tera, and also the
distinction between them and their resolved forms te&mdash;nei, &amp;c., have
been mentioned, page 30. Instances, however, are not rare, in which
those distinctions seem to be disregarded; and others will occur which
it will require some experience and ingenuity to classify; e.&nbsp;g., I
<i>te</i> po <i>nei</i> implies that it has been already dark for some
time; i <i>tenei</i> po may mean The night of this day. In the
following, Kei hea <i>te</i> awa <i>nei</i>? (<i>where is the channel
that we are seeking for?</i>) it is clear <i>tenei</i> could not be
employed.</p>

<p>(2.) Sometimes only <i>nei</i> will be admitted into connexion with
the first person; (i.&nbsp;e., when the speaker <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_134" id="page_134">{134}</a></span>is denoted as the person
looking at the object spoken of;) and <i>na</i> into connexion with the
second. <i>Ra</i> has for the most part a vague or general application.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_37" id="R_37" href="#F_37">[37]</a></span>
Thus a person, calling to a settlement, will say, Kahore he tangata i
te kainga nei? <i>Is there no one at that settlement?</i> (at which I
am looking.) If addressing another who belongs to, or has seen, the
settlement, he will say, i te kainga <i>na</i>, (or <i>ra</i>) <i>at
the settlement which you see there, or to which you belong</i>,
&amp;c. Again. Keihea nga kau? where are the cows? Kei <i>kona</i>
ano, <i>They are there near you</i>. If he had said, Kei ko, we should
have understood him to mean, "They are off, away, in that direction;"
na <i>kona</i> mai, <i>come by that direct path, in which you are</i>;
na <i>ko</i> mai, <i>come by that circuitous one away there</i>.</p>

<p>(3.) Nei, &amp;c., in composition will frequently supply the place
of the relative; e.&nbsp;g., te taua i muru <span
class="smcap">nei</span> i a Hone.</p>

<p>(4.) Sometimes they will imply a conjunction, or will otherwise
limit the sentence in which they occur, by implying a connection with
a previous sentence or thing. Thus, kahore au i pai, means <i>I am not
willing</i>; kahore <i>nei</i> ahau i pai will mean, <i>the reason was
because I was not willing</i>; or, <i>you know I was not</i>, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. Again, I a koutou <i>e</i> tatari <i>ana</i> will denote a
mere general remark, <i>while you are waiting</i>, I a koutou e tatari
<i>nei</i> denotes <i>while you are</i> <span class="smcap">thus</span>
<i>continuing to wait</i>; te wahine i whakarerea, <i>the woman who
was divorced</i>; te wahine i whakarerea <i>nei</i>, (or <i>ra</i>),
<i>the woman who was divorced under these</i> (or <i>those</i>)
<i>particular circumstances</i>, or, <i>on that particular
occasion</i>, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>The Interrogative Pronouns.</i>&mdash;<i>Wai</i> and <i>aha</i> are
often used to add intensity; <i>ma wai</i> e noho, e au?<span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_135" id="page_135">{135}</a></span><i>that
I should remain is for whom?</i> i.&nbsp;e., I won't remain. <i>Ko wai</i>
hoki ka kite i te hoenga o tenei taua, <i>maua nei</i>? <i>who saw the
departure of this hostile party, we two?</i> i.&nbsp;e., we did not at
all see this party's departure to fight with you; hei <i>aha</i> ma <i>wai</i>?
<i>For what purpose is it, for whom?</i> i.&nbsp;e., what good at all is
that for? kahore i rongo, kahore i aha, <i>he did not attend, he did not
what</i>; i.&nbsp;e., he did not at all listen; kahore aku kupu, <i>me he
aha, me he aha</i>, <i>I did not utter a word, if a what, if a what</i>;
i.&nbsp;e., I did not at all speak; ka hua ahau <i>he aha</i>, <i>I thought
it was a what</i>; i.&nbsp;e., I imagined it was something very important
you were going to talk about. Sometimes a personal pronoun will be
associated with an interrogative; e.&nbsp;g., ko <i>wai</i> hoki <i>taua</i> ka
kite atu? <i>Who, we two, can see it?</i> i.&nbsp;e., who knows?</p>

<h2><span class="fs80">CHAPTER XIX.</span><br />SYNTAX OF THE VERB.</h2>

<p><i>Of the Verbal Particles.</i>&mdash;The consideration of the verbal
particles, and of the other means by which a verb is modified in
Maori, has been reserved for the Syntax; chiefly because the
investigation of those subjects will involve also that of compound
propositions, and of other constructions which belong to this part of
Grammar.</p>

<p><i>E</i> (a) is sometimes used for the present, e.&nbsp;g.,
<i>e</i> noho mai, <i>he is sitting there close at hand</i>. (b) Most
frequently it is joined with <i>nei</i>, &amp;c.; e.&nbsp;g., <i>e</i>
riri <i>nei</i>, <i>who is angry with me</i>, &amp;c. (c) It is
sometimes used to denote the future; e.&nbsp;g., ko wai ma <i>e</i>
haere? <i>who will</i> go? He tokomaha <i>e</i> mate, <i>many will
die</i>. (d) It is chiefly employed to denote contingency, or some
future act on which something else depends; e.&nbsp;g., <i>E</i> riri
ia, <i>if he be angry</i>; <i>E</i> tae mai a Hone tonoa ake, <i>If
John comes here send him after me</i>; <i>E</i> hau, <i>if there be a
wind</i>.</p>

<div class="small">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;(1.) In such constructions
as the last, it will be found that the latter verb will generally,
except when it is in the imperative mood, be in the second person. In
the following sentence, for example, <i>E</i> muri ka puta mai nga
kuri ka puhia, <i>henceforward if dogs come here they will be
shot</i>, <i>e</i> is wrongly used; puhia being in the third person.
To this rule, however, there are exceptions.</p>

<p>(2.) There is a difference between <i>e</i> and <i>ka</i>, as
particles of the future; <i>ka</i> being of much more extensive use;
i.&nbsp;e., being used <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_137"
id="page_137">{137}</a></span>with all persons, and in all senses,
whether absolute or contingent; vid. <i>ka</i>.</p>

<p>(3.) There are, however, some constructions in which <i>e</i> is
always preferred; chiefly, we believe, when the verb is preceded by
some word with which it is in connexion; i.&nbsp;e., when it is
preceded by the negative adverb <i>kore</i>, and sometimes
<i>kahore</i>; e.&nbsp;g., ka <i>kore</i> e pai, <i>if he is not
willing</i>; <i>kahore e</i> tangi <i>she did not at all
cry</i>,&mdash;by the preposition <i>ma</i>; e.&nbsp;g., <i>ma</i> wai
<i>e</i> hanga? <i>who is to build it?</i>&mdash;and by <i>no</i>
(sometimes), <i>nohea e wera?</i> <i>Whence</i>, i.&nbsp;e., <i>why
should it take fire?</i>&mdash;by the pronouns <i>tera</i> and
<i>ehea</i>; e.&nbsp;g., <i>tera e</i> mate, he will die perhaps, ko
<i>ehea e</i> patua, <i>which are to be killed?</i>&mdash;by the noun
or pronoun in the possessive case (sometimes); e.&nbsp;g., <i>taku
e</i> pai ai <i>that which I like</i>, he aha tau e tohe? what are you
importuning about?&mdash;by <i>taihoa</i> and <i>taria</i>;
e.&nbsp;g., <i>taihoa e</i> haere <i>wait going</i>; i.&nbsp;e.,
<i>don't go for a while</i>.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;For the distinction between <i>e</i> and <i>ka</i>, when
prefixed to numerals; vid., numerals, chap. 17, sec. 5.</p>

</div>

<p>(e.) For <i>e</i> as prefixed to the imperative mood, vid. page 40
(c). It is generally omitted in that mood, when the verb is followed
by <i>atu</i>, <i>mai</i>, <i>ake</i>, <i>iho</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><i>Ana</i> is a particle corresponding, in many particulars, with
<i>ka</i>. It is most frequently employed, however, in the
continuation of a narrative, and does not often except in abrupt and
animated discourse, occupy a place in the leading clause of the
sentence.</p>

<p>The following examples illustrate this last remark. Ki te kahore e
homai, ina <i>haere ana</i> ahau, ka riro. <i>If it is not given,
certainly going I will depart</i>; ko nga tangata o Taranaki, <i>aia
ana</i> e matou ki te maunga, <i>the men of Taranaki, driven were they
by us to the mountain</i>. It will be seen that the verb preceding in
the above clauses gives a larger measure of emphasis than if another
word had gone before it. In such animated sentences, as the above, the
speaker will generally prefer <i>ana</i> to any other verbal particle.
But another leading use of <i>ana</i> is to denote a continuance of
action. The following extract from a translation of the first eight
chapters of Genesis, made some years since by the Church Missionaries,
will serve as an illustration of this, and our other remarks on this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_138" id="page_138">{138}</a></span>particle.
We may add that, though we suggest a few trifling alterations in the
part quoted, yet, considering the time in which it was made, it is
very creditable to the Maori knowledge of the translators.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Ch. 1, v. i. I te orokomeatanga i hanga e te Atua te rangi me te
 whenua.</p>

<p>2. A kihai whai ahua te whenua, i takoto kau; a ngaro ana i te pouri
 te mata o te hohonu. Haerere ana te Wairua o te Atua ki runga ki te
 mata o nga wai.</p>

<p>3. Mea ana te Atua, Kia marama; a kua marama.</p>

<p>4. A kite ana te Atua i te marama, pai ana; wehea ana e te Atua te
 marama i te pouri.</p>

<p>5. A huaina ana e te Atua te marama, hei ao.</p>

</div>

<p>In the first verse <i>ana</i> can have no place, it would give an
unpleasant jerk, as well as the appearance of levity, to a
commencement so methodical and dignified. Our translators, therefore,
with good taste, employed <i>i</i>; I te timatanga <i>i</i> hanga,
&amp;c. In the second verse, however, in the clause commencing <i>a
ngaro ana, &amp;c.</i>, it is very correctly used; because there is a
close connection between <i>that clause</i> and the one preceding. In
the third verse it is, we think, injudiciously used, because a new
subject is now commenced. We should, therefore, have preferred
<i>na</i> <span class="smcap">ka</span> <i>mea</i> te Atua. So also in
the commencement of the fourth verse, <i>A kite ana te Atua</i> i te
marama, pai ana. We should prefer, a <i>ka</i> kite, &amp;c. Pai
<i>ana</i> is, we think, objectionable. It is too abrupt, and
unconnected, and makes the <i>pai</i> refer to the <i>atua</i>, rather
than to <i>marama</i>. <i>E</i> pai <i>ana</i>, perhaps, or <i>he mea
pai</i>, would be preferable. <i>E&mdash;ana</i> is strictly the sign
of the present tense; e.&nbsp;g., <i>e</i> kai <i>ana</i>, <i>he is
eating</i>. Sometimes when it follows a past time its meaning will
also be past; as may be seen in our remarks on <i>ana</i> (vid. also
page 38, and our remarks on compound times).</p>

<p><i>Ka</i> is a particle of very extensive use. It is sometimes
employed to denote the present tense; e.&nbsp;g., ka pai, <i>it is good</i>.
It is the particle most frequently <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_139"
id="page_139">{139}</a></span>used in historic presents (vid. John
iv., 1, 3, and N. T. <i>passim</i>). It is very frequently used to
denote future events, and is often employed in hypothetic, or
contingent propositions; e.&nbsp;g., <i>ka</i> mate koe i a au; <i>you
will be killed by me</i>, <i>ka</i> haere ahau <i>ka</i> riri a Hone,
<span class="smcap">if</span> <i>I go, John will be angry</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;<i>Ka</i>, as a particle of
the present, will often differ in meaning from <i>e&mdash;ana</i>. For
example, ka tere te waka may signify <i>the canoe will drift</i>, or
<i>that it</i> <span class="smcap">drifts</span>; <i>e</i> tere
<i>ana</i>, that <i>it is drifting</i>.</p>

<p>For the distinctions between <i>ka</i> and <i>e</i> vid. <i>e</i>.
Occasionally <i>ka</i> is followed by <i>te</i>. Vid. two examples
page 57.</p>

<p><i>I</i>, a particle of the past time; vid. <i>kua</i>.</p>

<p>(a.) Sometimes, however, it is employed to denote the present; e.&nbsp;g.,
<i>koia</i> i riri <i>ai</i>, <i>for that cause is he angry?</i>
<i>na</i> te aha koe <i>i</i> tohe <i>ai</i> kia haere, <i>why do you
persist in going?</i> Ka tahi ano to hanganga <i>i</i> pai, <i>this
house (which I am now roofing) is now, for the first time, properly
done</i>.</p>

<p>(b.) Sometimes <i>i</i> is employed where contingency is designed;
e.&nbsp;g., he aha koa i pono he titaha, he titaha; i pono he hate, he hate
<i>well, it won't signify</i>. <i>If an axe happens to be (my payment)
let it so happen</i> (lit. let it be an axe). <i>If a shirt, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Ka whiua to tahi wahi ki tahaki, hei whakahere i tona Atua. <i>I</i>
whiua ranei ki te wahi tapu ranei; <i>i</i> whiua ranei ki te wahi noa
ranei, <i>he throws a portion to one side as an offering to his God</i>.
<i>It may have been thrown</i> (i.&nbsp;e., it matters not whether it is
thrown) <i>upon a sacred spot, or upon a spot not sacred</i>.</p>

<p><i>Kua</i>, the sign of the past tense; e.&nbsp;g., <i>kua</i> korero atu
ahau ki a ia, <i>I have spoken to him</i>.</p>

<p>(a.) The leading distinction between <i>kua</i> and <i>i</i> is, we
believe, that <i>kua</i> is unlimited (i.&nbsp;e., will not admit of
limitation), and <i>i</i> limited in construction; and that the
former, when it precedes in the sentence, will be <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_140" id="page_140">{140}</a></span>often found to correspond
to the perfect, the latter to the imperfect of English; e.&nbsp;g.,
<i>kua</i> kitea te mea <i>i</i> kimihia e koe? <span
class="smcap">has</span> <i>the thing been found that</i>
<span class="smcap">was</span> <i>sought for by you?</i> <i>Kua</i> ora
koe? Kahore, I ora ano au; a, hoki mai ana te mate; <i>have you
recovered? No, I did recover, but the sickness has returned.</i></p>

<p class="small">N.B.&mdash;It would, however, be very incorrect to
affirm, as have some good Maori scholars, that <i>kua</i> always
corresponds to the perfect, and <i>i</i> to the imperfect.</p>

<p>In accordance with the preceding remarks, it may be observed, 1st,
that <i>kua</i> is seldom used when the verb is preceded by the
<i>cause</i>, <i>time</i>, or other qualifying circumstance of the
action; i.&nbsp;e., when the verb is followed by <i>ai</i>. For example, we
might say <i>kua</i> patua, <i>he was killed</i>; but we could not
say, te take <i>kua</i> patua <i>ai</i>, <i>the cause for which he was
killed</i>; neither would it be correct to say, koia <i>kua</i> riri
<i>ai</i> ia, <i>for that cause was he angry</i>. 2dly. It will also,
we believe, be found that, in secondary clauses, in which the relative
is understood, <i>i</i> obtains a much more general use than
<i>kua</i>. For example, in the following sentence,&mdash;"enei mea
<i>kua</i> korerotia e koutou," we should prefer <i>i</i> korerotia.
3dly. <i>Kua</i> will seldom, when denoting the perfect or imperfect
tenses, be found associated with the particle <i>ko</i>; e.&nbsp;g., we very
seldom hear <i>ko</i> Hone <i>kua</i> haere, <i>it was John who
went</i>. In the following sentence, we disapprove of the use of both
of these particles:&mdash;e pai ana matou ki a ia, no te mea <i>ko</i> ia
<i>kua</i> atawhai mai ki a matou, <i>we love him, because he was kind
to us</i>. We should have preferred <i>mona i</i> atawhai, &amp;c.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_38" id="R_38" href="#F_38">[38]</a></span>
(4.) When a preposition <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_141"
id="page_141">{141}</a></span>immediately precedes, <i>kua</i> will
seldom be employed to denote the tenses; e.&nbsp;g., nonahea <i>i</i>
mate ai; <i>Since what time</i>, or, <i>at what time did he die?</i>
Nana ano <i>i</i> haere noa mai, <i>he came of himself</i>.</p>

<p>(5.) <i>Kua</i> is never used after the negative adverbs kahore,
kihai, and kiano; e.&nbsp;g., kahore ahau i rongo, <i>I have not heard</i>;
kiano <i>i</i> mate noa, <i>he has not yet died</i>.</p>

<p>(6.) The following, also, are constructions in which <i>kua</i> will
be found to give place to <i>i</i>: <i>Me</i> koutou hoki i whakarere
<i>i</i> to koutou kainga, <i>as ye also left your country</i>; <i>me
i</i> kahore koe, <i>if it had not been for you</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>In the following constructions, however, <i>kua</i> is prefixed:
<i>penei kua</i> ora, <i>in that case he would have lived</i>; <i>ano
kua</i> mate, <i>as if he were dead</i>; <i>me te</i> mea <i>kua</i>
waruhia, <i>as if it had been planed</i>; <i>Me</i> i kahore koe
<i>kua</i> mate au, <i>if it had not been for you, I should have
died</i>. In the following, however, <i>i</i> is preferred: <i>me</i>
i kahore koe <i>i</i> ora ai ahau, <i>If it had not been for you, (the
cause) why I was saved</i>; i.&nbsp;e., I should have been lost, but
for you.</p>

<p>(b.) <i>Kua</i> is sometimes employed where a present would be used in
English; e.&nbsp;g., <i>kua</i> mate, <i>he is dead</i>; <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_142" id="page_142">{142}</a></span><i>kua</i>
po, <i>it is dark</i>, or, is past sunset; <i>kua</i> riro, <i>he is gone</i>.</p>

<p>(c.) In animated narrations of past events, <i>kua</i> is sometimes
employed to give variety; e.&nbsp;g., te taenga atu o Hone, <i>kua</i>
mau ki te hamanu, e tatua ana, te tino haerenga, <i>so John goes,
he</i> <span class="smcap">has</span> <i>taken (his) cartouch box,
(he) is girding it on; the instant marching</i>.</p>

<p>(d.) Sometimes, also, when the speaker wishes to convey the idea of
a certain, and speedy accomplishment, he will (as did the Hebrews)
employ the past tense; e.&nbsp;g., E pa, he aha i kaiponuhia ai to
waru? <i>kua</i> whakahokia mai apopo, <i>Father why do you withhold
your plane? It will</i> <span class="smcap">surely</span> <i>be
returned to you to-morrow</i>; E hoa, reia atu; <i>kua</i> hoki mai
koe, <i>Friend, run (and tell them) you will be back (in quite time
enough)</i>; e noho ana tenei; <i>kua</i> pata iho te ua, e rere ana
ki rote ki te whare, <i>we are sitting here, but, immediately as soon
as it rains, we run into the house</i>.</p>

<p>(e.) Kua is often prefixed to denote an action which is to take place,
or has taken place previous to something else&mdash;in which latter use it
will sometimes correspond to the pluperfect of English; e.&nbsp;g., <i>I</i>
a koe <i>kua</i> riro, <i>after you had gone</i>. Mo te ara rawa ake
<i>kua</i> maoa, <i>that, exactly as he awakes, it may have been
cooked</i>; i.&nbsp;e., <i>it may be cooked against he awakes</i>. Me i noho
<i>kua</i> wha na rakau e toia, <i>if I had remained, four logs would
have been dragged</i>. Akuanei mau nga riwai <i>kua</i> kainga,
<i>presently, the potatoes that have been first eaten will be
yours</i>; i.&nbsp;e., your crop will be the soonest ripe. Huatu <i>ko</i>
tena <i>kua</i> ngakia, <i>no, but let that be first dug</i>.</p>

<p>Vid. our remarks on <i>ko</i>, when associated with <i>kua</i> (note
to <i>a</i>) (3).</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The student
will see, in the above examples, that <i>kua</i>, when employed in
this sense, will often enter into combinations which would not be
admitted under other tenses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_143"
id="page_143">{143}</a></span>KIA.&mdash;This particle has been
already considered, as far as it is connected with the imperative mood
(vid. page 40). There are, however, other uses of it, which are both
varied and important.</p>

<p>(a.) It may, in asking a question, be used for the future; e.&nbsp;g., Kia
haere ahau? Ne? Shall I go? shall I?</p>

<p>(b.) It may, also, be found where an hypothetic statement is made, or
an expectation, or other reference to some future event, is implied&mdash;a
use in which it will sometimes be found to correspond to the second
future indicative and perfect potential of English; e.&nbsp;g., E noho ki
konei; <i>kia</i> hoki mai ra ano ahau, <i>stop here until I shall
have returned</i>; <i>Kia</i> titiro atu matou, ka patua to matou hoa,
hei reira ka whakatika atu matou, <i>let us have seen</i> (i.&nbsp;e., if we
had but seen) <i>him strike our friend, we should then have risen</i>;
me noho <i>kia</i> ora, ka haere, <i>you had better remain, and when
you are well, depart</i>; e hoe katoa ana ratou, <i>kia</i> oti te
waka o Nini, <i>they are all going when Nini's canoe is finished</i>;
I raro ahau e whakarongo mai ana, <i>kia mate, kia</i> mate; a ka ora
noa ano, <i>I was at the northward waiting for news from here of his
death; but he has recovered</i>.</p>

<p>(c.) Often, when intensity of <i>negation</i>, <i>doubt</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i>, is intended, it will be used instead of the proper
particles of the present, past, and future; e.&nbsp;g., hore rawa <i>kia</i>
tika, <i>by no means is it correct</i>; kahore <i>kia</i> kotahi,
<i>not even one</i>; Ko au <i>kia</i> mate, ko ia <i>kia</i> ora?
<i>must I (by feeding this pig) starve, while he has food?</i> Kahore
ano <i>kia</i> haere noa! <i>not yet gone!</i></p>

<p>(2.) It is often found, also, in exclamations of wonder; e.&nbsp;g.,
<i>Kia</i> nui! <i>How large!</i></p>

<p>(3.) In the same sense, also, it is used where an infinitive would
be employed in the learned languages; particularly where
<i>contempt</i>, <i>disregard</i>, &amp;c., are denoted; e.&nbsp;g.,
Kia whakarongo atu ahau ki o korero <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_144"
id="page_144">{144}</a></span>hei aha? why should I listen to your
talk? lit. <i>that I should listen to your talk is for what?</i>
<i>Kia</i> ho atu taku poaka mo tena! <i>that I should give my pig for
that!</i> i.&nbsp;e., I will not give it.</p>

<p>(d.) <i>Kia</i> is frequently employed to denote the infinitive;
e.&nbsp;g., haere <i>kia</i> kite, <i>go to see</i>.</p>

<p>(e.) It will also be employed when the latter verb is an amplification
of the meaning of a preceding one; e.&nbsp;g., ahea hanga ai tou whare,
<i>kia oti</i>? <i>When will your house be built, that it may be
finished?</i> Te tangata e whiuwhiu ana i ana tikaokao, <i>kia wawe te
mate</i>! <i>The man who is pelting his fowls that they may be soon
dead!</i> Tanutanu rawa <i>kia</i> ngaro, <i>bury, bury deep, that it
may be concealed</i>; (a song.) Whiua, <i>kia</i> mamae, <i>beat it
that it may be pained</i>; na koutou <i>i</i> aki mai <i>kia</i> tata,
<i>it was you who pressed forward so as to be near</i>.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;There is a
distinction between <i>kia</i> and <i>ki te</i>, when prefixed to a
verb in the infinitive, which should be noticed. <span
class="smcap">Kia</span> is very seldom prefixed to a verb in the
active voice,&mdash;<i>ki te</i> almost always; e.&nbsp;g., Haere
<i>ki te</i> to i te waka. We could not say <i>kia to</i>.</p>

<p>(2.) <i>Kia</i> is almost always prefixed to the passive verb; <i>ki
te</i> very seldom; e.&nbsp;g., Tikina atu <i>kia</i> tirohia is <i>fetch it
to be seen</i>. Tikina atu <i>ki te</i> titiro is <i>fetch him to look
at it</i>. The following sentence is erroneous:&mdash;arahina <i>ki te</i>
patu, led to be killed. It should be <i>kia</i> patua, or e arahina e
patua ana.</p>

<p>Sometimes, before neuter verbs, either <i>kia</i> or <i>ki te</i> will
be employed; e.&nbsp;g., I mea ahau kia, (or ki te) haere.</p>

<p>Kia will most frequently be used when the former of the two verbs is
in the passive voice. Verbs following adjectives, by which
<i>ability</i>, <i>habit</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>, are denoted, will take <i>ki
te</i>; e.&nbsp;g., uaua <i>ki te</i> mahi, <i>strong to work</i>; e kino
<i>ki te</i> tahae, <i>is displeased at thieving</i>.</p>

<p>Between the uses of <i>kia</i> and <i>ki te</i> there may be often a
very material difference; e.&nbsp;g., e riri ana <i>ki te</i><span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_145" id="page_145">{145}</a></span><i>ata noho</i>
means <i>that he is angry at the stopping quiet</i>,&mdash;i.&nbsp;e., that
he wishes for war; e riri ana <i>kia</i> ata noho, means that <i>he is
repressing (them) that they may stop quiet</i>; ka tohe ki a maua <i>kia</i>
waru i te kai i te ra tapu, <i>they pressed us to scrape food on the
Sunday</i>. If it had been, Ka tohe ki <i>te</i> waru, &amp;c., the speaker
would have implied <i>that they</i> (the persons toheing) <i>persisted in
scraping, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Some foreigners seem remarkably careless in the use of this particle.
We subjoin a few instances in which it has been omitted, or introduced
erroneously. Ko tana hanga <i>kia</i> korero, <i>his custom was to
speak, &amp;c.</i>; it should be, <i>he</i> korero. E kore ahau e ahei
<i>kia</i> mea atu; it should be, ahei <i>te</i> mea atu. Ko te aroha
e whakahauhau ana i te tangata <i>hei</i> mahi; it should be, <i>ki
te</i> mahi. Whakatika <i>hei</i> patu; it should be, whakatika <i>ki
te</i> patu, or whakatika atu, <i>patua</i>.</p>

<p>It may be here observed that (1) some verbs have a partiality for
certain particles; e.&nbsp;g., hua <i>noa</i> ahau, or, <i>ka</i> hua ahau,
<i>I thought</i>; e kore <i>e</i> ahei <i>te</i> patu. (2.) Some verbs
very rarely take any verbal particle into connexion with them. Of this
sort are heoi, or heoti, kati, taihoa, penei (<i>in that case</i>),
and, sometimes, rokohanga, or rokohina.</p>

<p>(3.) Many constructions will be met with in which the verbal particle
is omitted. (a.) A common adverb of quantity or quality following the
verb will often cause the verbal particle to be dispensed with. (b.)
It is also omitted in constructions like the following:&mdash;<i>meake</i>
haere; whano mate; kei te ata haere ai; taihoa maua haere atu; &amp;c.
(c.) In animated discourse, the common verb will sometimes be used
without any kind of auxiliary; e.&nbsp;g., kaiponu noa ia, kaiponu noa,
<i>tangohia</i> e au. <i>Withhold it, withhold it as he might, yet I
took it away.</i></p>

<p>AI.&mdash;The Aborigines sometimes appear to vary in their use of this
particle; some introducing it into <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_146"
id="page_146">{146}</a></span>sentences in which others would omit it.
These instances, however, may, we believe, be reduced to one
class:&mdash;viz., to that in which <i>ai</i> is used in connexion
with <i>kia</i>.</p>

<p>When <i>kia</i> is prefixed to a verb which is merely an
explanation, or some other enlargement of the meaning of a preceding
one, it will seldom take <i>ai</i> after it; as may be seen in our
examples of <i>kia</i>, (rules <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>). But when the
<i>intention</i>, <i>cause</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>, are to be specifically
denoted, then <i>ai</i> will be used. Thus, in the following sentence,
haere kia kite, <i>go to see</i>, <i>kite</i> is a plainly natural
effect of <i>haere</i>, and <i>ai</i>, therefore, is omitted. If,
however, some unusual act is to be done that he might see, then
<i>ai</i>, most probably, would be employed; thus, e piki ki runga ki
te rakau kia kite <i>ai</i> koe, <i>climb up the tree</i> <span
class="smcap">that</span> <i>you</i> <span class="smcap">may</span>
<i>see</i>. The distinction is the same as that between the two
following in English:&mdash;<i>go</i> <span class="smcap">and</span>
<i>see</i>; <i>climb</i> <span class="smcap">that</span> <i>you may
see</i>. Again, in the last example of kia (rule <i>e</i>), na koutou
i aki mai kia tata, "nearness" is a natural effect of "pressing
forward," even though they had no specific intention of being near:
<i>ai</i>, therefore, is not used. If, however, the speaker wished to
say <i>ye pressed forward</i> <span class="smcap">that</span> <i>I
might be angry</i>, he would employ <i>ai</i>; kia riri <i>ai</i>
ahau; because here we have two acts, not necessarily connected, and
one specifically performed to produce the other.</p>

<p>The following are a few out of the many instances that might be
adduced of the erroneous introduction, and erroneous omission, of this
particle:&mdash;e kore koe e pohehe me ratou, <i>kia</i> roa <i>ai</i>
taku korerotanga, <i>you are not ignorant (as they are), that I should
be long explaining it to you</i>; it should be, <i>e roa ai</i>. As it
stands it means, <span class="smcap">you will not make yourself
"pohehe," in order that</span>, &amp;c. Aua e whakaara ake i tetahi
rakau <i>kia</i> tu <i>ai</i>, <i>erect not any stick that it may
stand</i>; it should be rakau, <i>tu ai</i>. Kihai i
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_147" id="page_147">{147}</a></span>tonoa
kia uia <i>ai</i> matou, <i>he was not sent to question us</i>; it should be,
<i>ki te</i> ui i a matou. Ko nga mutunga o ia waiata, o ia waiata, kia
whakahuatia <i>ai</i> tenei waiata, <i>at the end of each song let this chant
be repeated</i>. As this stands, its meaning is, <i>in order that this
chant may be repeated</i>; it should be, <i>kia</i> whakahuatia tenei,
&amp;c., or <i>ka</i> whakahua <i>ai</i>. Ka puta te kupu o Hone <i>kia</i>
haere atu <i>ai</i> ratou, when John speaks, let them proceed; it should be,
me haere, &amp;c., or ka haere. A wrong use of this particle may often
seriously misrepresent the meaning of the speaker. For example, if we
were to say, e inoi ana ahau <i>kia</i> murua <i>ai</i> oku hara, we should
mean, <i>I pray that (in consideration of my prayer) my sins may be
forgiven</i>. Prayer, here, is made the immediate and effective means by
which this end is obtained. If a Native were to say, "E inoi ana ahau
kia homai <i>ai</i> tetahi paraikete," absurd as would be the remark, it
would mean that the blanket is to be given to him, not as a favor, or
as due on other grounds, but simply as a <i>reward</i> for <i>his asking</i>.
The Bible tells us of another consideration, by which pardon is
obtained, and prayer answered; and, therefore, in such passages as the
above, we must carefully abstain from <i>ai</i>. Koia nga tamariki a Hone i
haere tahi me ratou; it should be, i haere tahi <i>ai</i>. E kore ia e poka
ke i tana i mea; it should be, i mea <i>ai</i>; te tangata <i>i</i> he
<i>ai</i>, the man who had committed the offence. In Waikato this will mean,
<i>the man through whom they had erred</i>; it should have been, <i>te
tangata nona te he</i>.</p>

<p>(a.) <i>Whaka.</i>&mdash;The leading property of this particle is
<i>causative</i>; e.&nbsp;g., <i>tu</i> is <i>to stand</i>, whakatu is <i>to
cause to stand</i> (vid. etiam, page 50, under pai, kau, and kakahu,
and Syntax of Numbers, under Ordinals).</p>

<div class="small">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;In this use of it,
adjectives, and neuter verbs, will be converted into active verbs;
e.&nbsp;g., toe, <i>to be left</i>; whakatoe, <i>to put by, as a
leaving</i>; e.&nbsp;g., <i>whaka</i>toea etahi ma mea ma, <i>put by
some for our friends</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_148"
id="page_148">{148}</a></span>In the following example, the adjective
is made improperly to retain the form of a neuter verb, he mea
<i>whakapirau i te</i> hau, <i>a thing blasted by the wind</i>. Its
meaning, as its stands, is, <i>a thing that destroys the wind</i>.</p>

<p>Considerable variety may sometimes be found in the nature of the
causation implied by this prefix. Thus, puru, <i>to cork (a bottle,
&amp;c.)</i>. Whakapurua nga pounamu, <i>to stow, or pack (with straw,
&amp;c., between) them</i>. Waha, <i>to carry on the back</i>;
whakawaha, <i>to take up the load on the back</i>; e.&nbsp;g., waiho
atu e au e whakawaha ana, <i>as I came away they were loading
themselves with their burdens</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>(b.) Sometimes it will imply the <i>becoming</i>, or the <i>being
like to</i>, or the <i>feigning</i>, or <i>exhibiting the</i> root to
which it is prefixed. Frequently, also, it will indicate an
<i>origin</i> or <i>propriety</i> in the root; e.&nbsp;g., Kei te
<i>whaka</i>riwai a Hone i roto i te rua, <i>John is making himself
potatoes</i>, i.&nbsp;e., (is occupying the place of) <i>in the
rua</i> (or potatoe house); ka po, ka <i>whaka</i>ahi; ka awatea, ka
<i>whaka</i>kapua, <i>at night it became a fire, by day it became a
cloud</i>; kia <i>whaka</i>tangata, <i>to act like a man</i>; ka riro,
ka <i>whaka</i>-Hone ki te wai, <i>he will be off, and become like
John in the water</i>; i.&nbsp;e., will be drowned as John was; he
kupu <i>whaka</i>-te-Kanaua, <i>a speech made by Kanaua</i>;
i.&nbsp;e., any promise, &amp;c., made by him; he tangata
<i>whaka</i>-Ngapuhi, <i>a person belonging to, or that frequently
visits</i> Ngapuhi; he aha kei to tatou hoa? Kahore pea. E
<i>whaka</i>matemate noa iho ana, kia kiia e mate ana, <i>What is the
matter with our friend? Nothing at all. He is feigning sickness, that
he may be regarded as unwell.</i></p>

<p>(c.) Sometimes it will denote <i>reciprocity</i>; e.&nbsp;g., ko ratou
<i>whaka</i>ratou hoki, <i>he is one of themselves</i>! (d.) Sometimes it
will denote an action either <i>inceptive</i> or <i>gradually
declining</i>; e.&nbsp;g., e <i>whaka</i>tutuki ana te tai, <i>the tide is
beginning to get full</i>; e <i>whaka</i>hemohemo ana, <i>he is
sinking</i>; i.&nbsp;e., is on the point of death. (e.) Sometimes it will
denote <i>towards</i>; vide page 71. (f.) Occasionally it will
indicate some <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_149"
id="page_149">{149}</a></span>action corresponding to the sense of the
root; e.&nbsp;g., ka <i>whaka</i>-ahiahi ratou, <i>they act at
sunset</i>; i.&nbsp;e., they wait for sunset to make their assault.</p>

<p><i>The other auxiliaries of the verb.</i>&mdash;These, it has been
already observed, are adverbs, prepositions, pronouns, and the
articles <i>he</i> and <i>te</i>, placed in connection with the verb.
We proceed to make a few remarks upon them, and some other forms which
the Maori verb occasionally assumes:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>On the adverbs as auxiliaries.</i>&mdash;These chiefly are the
adverbs of intensity and negation; we may add, also, the particles
atu, mai, ake, iho.</p>

<p>The adverbs of intensity, as well as the last mentioned particles,
will frequently lose their distinctive force, and either in some way
modify the meaning; i.&nbsp;e., denote <i>rapidity</i> and
<i>certainty</i> of <i>effect</i>, <i>succession</i> or
<i>connection</i> of events, &amp;c., or be redundant. The following
examples will, it is hoped, sufficiently illustrate their
use:&mdash;te whakaarahanga ake o te ra, tahuri <i>tonu iho</i>, the
putting up of the sail <i>forthwith</i> was it upset; akuanei,
<i>ahiahi noa</i>, ka tata ta maua te oti, <i>presently</i> <span
class="smcap">by sunset</span> <i>ours will be near being
finished</i>; mo te ara <i>rawa ake</i> o nga tamariki kua maoa, <span
class="smcap">that exactly</span> <i>as</i> <span
class="smcap">the</span> <i>children awake it may have been
cooked</i>; i.&nbsp;e., <i>it may be cooked before they awake</i>;
kahore, ha, he kainga; <i>kainga<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_39"
id="R_39" href="#F_39">[39]</a></span> rawa atu</i> ki Waitoke, <i>oh,
there is no settlement</i> (in the interval); <i>the nearest
settlement is Waitoke</i>; tia <i>rawa</i> ki te raukura, pani
<i>rawa</i> ki te kokowai, <i>he braided his hair with feathers, and
besmeared himself with red ochre</i>; <i>te tino</i> haerenga, so on
<i>they started</i>.</p>

<p class="small">N.B.&mdash;Between <i>noa ake</i> and <i>noa atu</i>
a distinction will sometimes be found not unlike that which obtains
between the perfect and imperfect of English. <i>Noa ake</i> will
generally convey an <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_150"
id="page_150">{150}</a></span>allusion to some date, either present or
past; <i>noa atu</i> will most frequently refer to the past, without
any such allusion; e.&nbsp;g., kua mate, <i>noa ake</i>, <i>he has
been dead this some time</i>; kua mate <i>noa atu</i>, <i>he died a
long time ago</i>; kua maoa, <i>noa ake</i> te kai, <i>the food has
been this long time cooked</i>; kua maoa <i>noa atu</i>, <i>it was
cooked a long time ago</i>; kua mate <i>noa ake</i> i reira, <i>he had
been dead then some time</i>; kua mate <i>noa atu</i> i reira, <i>he
had been dead a long time previous to that date</i>.</p>

<p>For further illustrations of the adverbs as auxiliaries the student is
referred to chapter 9, pages 78, 79, &amp;c. For the negative adverbs, as
employed with the verb, vid. next chapter.</p>

<p><i>Of the Prepositions.</i>&mdash;The use of these as auxiliaries
is to supply the place of the verb substantive when no verb is
expressed in the sentence; e.&nbsp;g., <i>naku</i> tenei, <i>this is
mine</i>; <i>kei</i> hea? <i>where is it?</i> <i>I</i> a au i runga,
<i>when I was at the Southward</i>. The tenses they denote, and those
also which they admit after them, have been mentioned, chapter 8.
Other notices respecting them will be found in the next chapter. For
the pronouns as auxiliaries, vid. page 35.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_40" id="R_40" href="#F_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Verbs which assume the form of a noun.</i>&mdash;It has been already
observed that Maori inclines to the substantive form; and that such is
only natural will be obvious to anyone who will reflect that it is more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_151" id="page_151">{151}</a></span>easy
for an unpolished mind to conceive of things as existences, than to
trace them through the various modifications of act denoted in a verb.
In many instances, indeed, a New Zealander is compelled to adopt this
form, in consequence of the Maori verb not supplying any satisfactory
form for the infinitive mood, and the participles. That these two
parts of speech strongly partake of the nature of a noun is well
known; and we may therefore be prepared to find the forms for denoting
them in Maori exhibit a mixed character; i.&nbsp;e., to be a kind of
compound of the verb and the noun. It may be added, also, that, as in
some Latin authors, the infinitive mood is often used for the finite
verb;<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_41" id="R_41"
href="#F_41">[41]</a></span> so also, in Maori, will the verbal noun,
especially when a brief and animated mode of diction is desired, be
found very frequently to occupy the place of the verb.</p>

<p>The following examples illustrate the various modes in which the Maori
verb adopts the substantive form.</p>

<p>The student will observe that even passive verbs will submit to the
same operation, and receive the sign of the substantive, (viz. the
article) before them; e.&nbsp;g., Tenei au <i>te tu</i> atu nei,
<i>here am I</i> <span class="smcap">the</span> <i>standing towards
(you)</i>; he kainga hou <i>te rapua</i> nei, <i>a new country is the
being sought</i>, i.&nbsp;e., is what we are seeking for; ko koe
<i>te</i> korerotia nei, it is <i>you who are the being talked
about</i>; <i>he noho</i> aha tau? <i>what are you sitting for?</i>
kua oti <i>te keri</i>, <i>it is finished, the being dug</i>; ka tata
ahau <i>te patua</i> e koe, <i>I am near, the being beaten by you</i>;
he mohio koe? <i>are you a knowing?</i> i.&nbsp;e., do you know
anything about it?</p>

<p>The following are examples of <i>the verbal noun as used for the
finite verb</i>:&mdash;me he mea <i>ko te mahuetanga</i> <span
class="pagenum"><a name="page_152" id="page_152">{152}</a></span>o to
matou waka, <i>if it had been the leaving of our canoe</i>, i.&nbsp;e., if
our canoe had been left to us; kei riri mai ia ki te kai; <i>te taunga</i>
iho&mdash;ko ia, ko tana waka, <i>lest he (the God) be angry at the food
(not having been given)&mdash;the alighting (upon him, the priest),
&amp;c.</i>, i.&nbsp;e., and should then alight upon him, &amp;c.; haere
atu ana a Rona ki <i>te kawe</i> wai, Ka pouri. <i>Te kanganga</i> ki te marama.
Te <i>tino tikinga</i> iho nei, ka tae ki a Rona, <i>Rona</i> (the man in the
moon) <i>goes to fetch water. It is dark. The cursing at the moon. The
instant coming down to him, &amp;c.</i>, i.&nbsp;e., he cursed at the
moon, and she in anger came down to him.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;More examples
of this very animated mode of narration might be easily adduced. The
student will find several others scattered throughout this work. We
may observe, also, that the very frequent use of this form by the
natives constitutes one remarkable feature by which the language, as
spoken by him, differs from that spoken by the foreigner.</p>

<p>As a further illustration of the way in which predication in Maori is
sometimes performed by the substantive, the following forms may be
mentioned:&mdash;<i>he mea whakamaori</i> no te reo pakeha, <i>a thing
translated from the foreigner's tongue</i>, i.&nbsp;e., it was translated
from, &amp;c. Na Hone tenei, <i>he mea ho atu na</i> Pita,&mdash;<i>this is
John's, it was presented to him by Pita</i>: lit. it was a thing
presented, &amp;c. Akuanei, he <i>noho atu te otinga</i>, <i>presently a
remaining away will be the end</i>, i.&nbsp;e., (we shall find that) he will
remain away.</p>

<p>It should be also noted that the following verbs always take the
substantive form after them, viz., hohoro, oti, hei, and ahei, pau,
taea, tau, timata, heoi ano, kati, poto; e.&nbsp;g., timata <i>te mahi</i>,
<i>commence to work</i>; kati <i>te tahae</i>, <i>stop thieving,
&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;These verbs,
it would appear, deserve most justly the appellation of "auxiliaries,"
1st, as they are real verbs; and 2ndly, as by their help we can
approximate to many forms of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_153"
id="page_153">{153}</a></span>verb in other languages. For example,
kua <i>oti te tiki</i>, mai, <i>has been</i> fetched hence; e kore e
<i>ahei te korero</i>, cannot <i>divulge</i>.</p>

<p>The use of the verbal noun, it would appear, is very prevalent in
Oriental languages (vid. Lee Heb. Gram., second edition, p.p. 75 and
76, and Carey's Gram. of the Burman, also Humboldt on the Chinese, as
there quoted.) The following form, however, will often be found in
Maori to supersede it.</p>

<p>A noun, or pronoun, in the oblique case, will, frequently, in
Maori, take the finite verb after it;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="R_42" id="R_42" href="#F_42">[42]</a></span> e.&nbsp;g., e
whakapono ana ahau ki a <i>ia i mate</i> i a <i>Ponotio Pirato</i>.</p>

<p>The expression "ki tana hekenga atu ki te reinga" is precisely the
same as "ki a ia i heke atu ki, &amp;c." Again, <i>Noku i haere</i> mai
nei, <i>since I arrived here</i>: lit., <i>from or of me</i> (I mean)
<i>came here</i>; ko te rua tenei o nga wiki <i>o Hone, i hoki ai</i>,
<i>this is the second week since John returned</i>: lit., <i>this is
the second week of John</i> (I mean) <i>returned</i>; <i>i a ia e
ngaro ana</i>, <i>whilst he is hid</i>; <i>mo ratou</i> kahore <i>i
rongo</i>, <i>because they would not obey</i>: lit., <i>for them</i>
(I mean) <i>their not having obeyed</i>.</p>

<p>Often, also, a noun, which, in English, would be in the nominative,
will, in Maori, be converted into the possessive; the verb following
as in the preceding rule; e.&nbsp;g., <i>naku i patu</i>, <i>I struck</i>:
lit., <i>it was mine</i> (I mean) <i>the having struck it</i>; <i>maku
e korero</i>, <i>I will speak</i>: lit., <i>it will be for me</i> (I
mean) <i>the speaking</i>.</p>

<p class="small">It was most probably, through ignorance of this, and
the preceding rule, that some good Maori speakers adopted the
following very unsatisfactory analysis of the two examples first
adduced:&mdash;"Naku i patu," they would translate, <i>it was struck by</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_154" id="page_154">{154}</a></span><i>me</i>;
"maku e korero," <i>it shall be spoken by me</i>; and they thus explain
them: <i>Na</i> and <i>ma</i> mean <i>by</i>; and <i>patu</i> and <i>korero</i>,
though active in <i>form</i>, are passive in <i>meaning</i>. To this theory,
however, there are strong objections. (1.) It cannot be shewn, except
by examples derived from this class, that <i>na</i> and <i>ma</i> ever signify
<i>by</i>; these words all must admit are the active form of <i>no</i> and
<i>mo</i>&mdash;the prepositions which denote the possessive case. (2.) It
will altogether fail in those instances in which other prepositions,
besides <i>na</i> and <i>ma</i> are found. In the following, for
example:&mdash;"i a au e noho ana i reira," <i>whilst I was sitting
there</i>; nona i tango, <i>because he took it</i>, it will be seen that it is
as difficult to determine the nominatives of "noho" and "tango" as it
was to determine those of patu and korero in the other examples. Those
who attend to the genius of the language (vid. preliminary remarks,
pages 102 and 103, and Syntax of Nouns, sec. 3, page 114) will, we
think, find but little difficulty in the question. They will see that
there are no participles, adverbs, or relative pronouns, in Maori, and
that, therefore, we must not be surprised at a construction which,
though loose, is admirably adapted to supply the defect. That Maori
has a peculiar love for the possessive form in predication, especially
when a relative pronoun is understood, may be seen in the following
examples<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_43" id="R_43"
href="#F_43">[43]</a></span>:&mdash;ko Tiaki anake <i>ta matou i kite</i>,
<i>Tiaki was the only person that we saw</i>: lit., Tiaki was our only one
(actively) (I mean) saw; ka tohe ki <i>tana i pai ai</i>, <i>he holds out for
what he desired</i>: lit., he holds out for his (I mean) desired; he mate
<i>toku</i>, <i>I am sick</i>: lit., a sickness is mine; ka tika <i>tau</i>,
you are right: lit., yours is right; <i>koe</i> would not be here used; ko
<i>taku noho</i> tenei, a, po noa, <i>I will sit here till night</i>:
lit., this is my sitting until night.</p>

<p>The leading meaning of <i>na</i>, and <i>ma</i>, and their
corresponding passives <i>no</i>, and <i>mo</i>, seems to be, of the
one class, <i>present</i>, or <i>past</i>, of the other <i>future
possession</i>. And most of the examples given in p.p. 63-67, of
their various uses might be reduced to those heads. Thus, "<i>no</i>
te mane i haere mai ai," means, literally, <i>it was of the
Monday</i>, (I mean,) <i>having come</i>. "<i>No</i> reira i riri," it
was <i>of that cause</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_155"
id="page_155">{155}</a></span>(I mean,) <i>the having been angry</i>;
<i>mo</i> a mua haere ai, <i>let it be for a future period</i>, (I
mean,) <i>the going</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Compound tenses.</i><span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_44"
id="R_44" href="#F_44">[44]</a></span>&mdash;A compound tense is one
whose time and quality are modified by some other time or circumstance
with which it is connected.</p>

<p>Thus in the examples in page 38 <i>me i reira</i> ahau <i>e</i> pai
<i>ana</i>, <i>e</i>&mdash;<i>ana</i>, which taken <i>absolutely</i>, is
present, now represents the pluperfect potential; because it has a
reference to <i>i reira</i>, a past time, and to <i>me</i>, a particle
denoting contingency. Again, in the example, "akuanei tae rawa atu
<i>kua</i> mate; <i>kua</i>, taken absolutely, refers to past time;
but, here, it is taken <i>relatively</i>, and refers to a future; i.&nbsp;e.
to the time in which I may arrive; the sentence meaning, literally,
"presently, exactly as I shall have arrived, he is dead." The
expression <i>shall have been dead</i>, in English, all will see, is a
compound tense of a similar character, for it is <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_156" id="page_156">{156}</a></span>compounded of a future,
and a past tense, and thus represents a <i>second future</i>.</p>

<p>We proceed to lay before the student some examples of the most
important combinations of time and mood. To exhibit all that are
possible would extend our work beyond its prescribed limits. Some
remarks on this subject have been already made in treating on the
verbal particles.</p>

<h3>INDICATIVE MOOD.</h3>

<p><i>Present.</i>&mdash;<i>Ka</i> taka ki hea, <i>e</i> haere mai <i>ana</i>?
<i>they have reached what place as they come along?</i></p>

<p><i>Imperfect tense.</i>&mdash;<i>Rokahanga</i> atu e au, <i>i re</i>ira
<i>e</i> noho <i>ana</i>, <i>when I arrived he was sitting there</i>:
lit., he is sitting, &amp;c. <i>I</i> mua <i>e</i> pai <i>ana</i>,
<i>formerly I liked</i> (it): lit., I like, &amp;c. <i>E</i> pai <i>ana
i</i> mua&mdash;id. <i>I</i> pai ano <i>i</i> mua&mdash;id. <i>Na</i> reira
<i>i</i> kore ai ahau <i>e</i> pai, <i>that was the cause why I did
not assent</i>: lit., thence <i>was</i> I not, (I mean) <i>am</i>
pleased. <i>I</i> ki hoki ia, a <i>kua</i> oti; <i>i</i> mea atu ia,
a, tu <i>tonu iho</i>, <i>he spake, and it was done; he commanded and
it stood fast</i>. <i>Heoi</i> ahau me tenei tamaiti, <i>ka</i> haere
mai; <i>I was the size of this child when I came here</i>.</p>

<p><i>I hea</i> koe i mua, <i>ka</i> kimi? <i>where were you before that
you did not look for it?</i></p>

<p>Nei hoki, <i>kua</i> ora, haere <i>ana</i> ki Taranaki, <i>but he
recovered, and went to Taranaki</i>; <i>kua</i> mea atu ra hoki;
<i>e</i> ki mai <i>ana</i>, <i>why I said so, he replies</i>, i.&nbsp;e.,
<i>replied</i>.</p>

<p><i>Perfect tense.</i>&mdash;<i>Ka</i> wha nga wiki <i>e</i> ngaro
<i>ana</i>, (or <i>ka</i> ngaro <i>nei</i>;) <i>it has been lost these
last four weeks</i>: lit., <i>these</i> <span class="smcap">are</span>
<i>four weeks</i> <span class="smcap">it is</span> <i>lost</i>.</p>

<p><i>I</i> konei te kuri <i>e</i> kai <i>ana</i>, mei te huruhuru, <i>a
dog has been eating a fowl here, as we may judge from the
feathers</i>. <i>No</i>ku <i>ka</i> mate, <i>since I have been
poorly</i>.</p>

<p><i>Pluperfect tense.</i>&mdash;<i>Kihai</i> i hinga <i>ka</i> waiho e
korua, <i>it had not fallen when you left it</i>, lit., it did not
fall, you leave it. <i>I</i> a koe <i>kua</i> riro, <i>after you had
gone</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_157"
id="page_157">{157}</a></span>(vid. our remarks on <i>kua</i>, page
153 for other examples.)</p>

<p><i>First future tense.</i>&mdash;<i>Ma</i> Ngatiwhatua <i>e</i> takitaki to
maua mate, ka ea, <i>Ngatiwhatua will avenge our murder, (and) a
satisfaction will be obtained</i>.</p>

<p><i>Akuanei</i>, rangona <i>rawatia</i> mai, <i>e</i> hoko <i>ana</i>
ano koe, <i>presently, I</i> <span class="smcap">shall</span> <i>hear
that you</i> <span class="smcap">are still</span> <i>purchasing</i>:
lit., presently, exactly as it has been heard, you are, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Kua</i> mate ahau, <i>e</i> ora <i>ana</i> ano nga rakau nei,
<i>these trees will live longer than I</i>: lit., I died, these
trees are still alive.</p>

<p><i>Second future tense.</i>&mdash;Vid. pag. 37.</p>

<h3>POTENTIAL AND SUBJUNCTIVE MOODS.</h3>

<p><i>Present and imperfect.</i>&mdash;(For examples of these vid. on <i>e</i>
page 136, on <i>ka</i> 138, and on <i>ai</i> 146), <i>ko</i> ahau
<i>kia</i> mate, ko ia <i>kia</i> ora; vid. on <i>kia</i> (§. c. 1,)
also our remarks on ahei, taea, &amp;c., as auxiliaries.</p>

<p><i>Pluperfect.</i>&mdash;<i>Kua</i> riro au, na te mate o taku kotiro
<i>i</i> noho ai, <i>I would have gone; but I remained in consequence
of the sickness of my daughter</i>: lit., I departed, my daughter's
sickness was the cause of my having remained; <i>e</i> noho
<i>ana</i>, <i>na</i> Hone <i>i</i> ngare, <i>he would have stopped,
but John sent him</i>: lit., he is remaining, John sent him; <i>E</i>
murua a Hone, <i>naku i</i> ora ai, <i>John would have been plundered,
but I saved him</i>; <i>me i</i> kahore ahau <i>kua</i> mate, <i>if it
had not been for me, he would have died</i>; <i>kua</i> hemo ke ahau,
<i>me</i> i <i>kaua</i> ahau te whakapono, <i>I should have fainted if
I had not believed</i>; penei <i>kua</i> ora, <i>in that case he would
have been saved</i>; <i>ka</i> hua ahau, <i>i</i> haere <i>ai</i>,
<i>e</i> rongo; <i>I thought that they would have listened (which) was
the cause of (my) having gone</i>; <i>ma</i>ku i runga <i>e</i> kore e
marere, <i>when I am at the Southward (it) is never granted</i>; ma
raua e rere e kore e hohoro a Raiana, <i>when they both run, Lion does
not make haste</i>; me i maku e keri, keihea? <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_158" id="page_158">{158}</a></span><i>if it had not been for
me to dig it where (should I have been now)?</i> i.&nbsp;e., I should have
dug to a vast distance.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_45" id="R_45"
href="#F_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The following combinations of times are incorrect: <i>i</i> te mea
<i>i</i> arahina nga Hurai, <i>while the Jews were being led</i>; it
should be <i>e</i> arahina <i>ana</i>. <i>I</i> kite hoki ratou i a
ia, a, <i>i</i> rere, <i>for they saw him and fled</i>; it should be,
<i>a</i>, rere <i>ana</i>. To ratou taenga atu ki te pa, i reira ano
mahara ana ratou ki a ia, <i>and when they had reached the pa, they
then recognised him</i>; it should be na, <i>ka</i> mahara, &amp;c. Ma
Hone <i>e</i> whakaki o koutou peke, <i>pera</i> hoki me o matou,
<i>John will fill your bags as full as ours</i>; it should be, <i>kia
penei me o matou</i>. It may be here noted that when two tenses are
connected together, not in the way of government, but are rather in
apposition with each other, the latter will generally be the same as,
or at least correspond to, the former; e.&nbsp;g., the following
constructions are erroneous:&mdash;<i>Korerotia</i> atu, <i>mea ana</i>,
<i>speak, saying</i>; it should be, <i>meatia</i>. A ki atu <i>ana</i>
a Hone, ka <i>mea</i>; it should be, mea <i>ana</i>. Ka tahi ahau
<i>i</i> kite, <i>now for the first time have I seen</i>; it should be
<i>ka</i> kite.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Sometimes,
however, we meet with exceptions to this rule: (1) when there is a
clear case for the operation of epanorthosis; (2) when the particles
<i>a</i> or <i>na</i> intervene.</p>

<p>The character of the sentence will sometimes be found to affect the
time of the verb; as, for example, in animated narration, where a
large measure of certainty, or when contingency is to be denoted, &amp;c.;
e.&nbsp;g., Kihai i u ki uta, <i>kua</i> tae ki te whare, <i>kua</i> totoro
ki te maripi, ki te paoka, <i>E</i> kai <i>ana</i>, <i>he had not
landed, before he</i> <span class="smcap">had</span> <i>reached the house</i>,
<span class="smcap">had</span> <i>stretched out</i> <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_159" id="page_159">{159}</a></span><i>(his hand) to the knife
and fork, (he) is eating</i>, i.&nbsp;e., immediately as soon as he
landed he began to eat; E pa ma, kia kaha, Kahore kua u, <i>My friends
be strong, (in pulling the oar), O no, we have landed</i>, i.&nbsp;e., we
are close to shore. A request or command, given to be conveyed to
another, will often be put into the imperative, just as if the
individual, to whom the request, &amp;c., is to be delivered, were
really present; e.&nbsp;g., Mea atu ki a Hone, <i>Taihoa e haere</i>, <i>say
to John, Don't go for a while</i>. E kite koe i a te Keha, <i>Haere mai</i>,
<i>if you see Keha</i> (say to him), <i>Come here</i>.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This form is
generally adopted when the speaker wishes to be animated and abrupt.
Sometimes, as in the first example, it is the only form admissible.</p>

<p><i>Verbs associated to qualify each other.</i>&mdash;It should here also be
noted that when two verbs are associated together, the latter of which
is modified in meaning by the former, in a way somewhat similar to
that in which the infinitive in Latin is modified by its governing
verb, the two verbs will, generally, be in the same tense and voice;
e.&nbsp;g., <i>Kua</i> haere, <i>kua</i> koroheke hoki, <i>he has begun to
get old</i>, lit., he is gone, he is old; <i>kei</i> anga koe,
<i>kei</i> korero, <i>don't you go and say, &amp;c.</i>; <i>e</i>
aratakina <i>ana</i>, e patua <i>ana</i>, <i>it is led to be
killed</i>.</p>

<p><i>Repetition of Verbs.</i>&mdash;The same verb will frequently be repeated
in Maori when <i>contingency</i>, <i>intensity</i>,
<i>distribution</i>, <i>diversity</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>, are intended, and,
particularly, when the speaker desires to be impressive and emphatic;
e.&nbsp;g., Ko te mea i tupono i tupono: ko te mea i kahore i kahore,
<i>(the karakia Maori) is all a work of chance: sometimes there is a
successful hit, sometimes a failure</i>, lit., that which hit the mark
hit it, that which did not did not; e pakaru ana, e pakaru ana ki tana
mahi <i>(it does not much signify) if it breaks, it is broken in his
service</i>; okioki, okioki atu ki a i a, <i>trust, trust in him</i>,
i.&nbsp;e., place your whole trust in, &amp;c.; haere ka haere, kai ka kai,
<i>in all his goings</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_160"
id="page_160">{160}</a></span><i>in all his eatings</i>, i.&nbsp;e.,
whenever he walks, or eats, (<i>he retains the same practice</i>);
heoi ano ra, heoi ano, <i>that is all about it, that is all about
it</i>; hapai ana, hapai ana, <i>raise both ends at the same time</i>;
i.&nbsp;e., <i>while you raise, I raise</i>.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;A similar
usage obtains in other parts of the language; e.&nbsp;g., ko wai, ko
wai te haere? <i>who, who is to go?</i> ko tera tera, <i>that is
another</i>, or <i>a different one</i>; he kanohi he kanohi, <i>face
to face</i>; ko Roka ano Roka, ko ahau ano ahau? <i>are Roka</i> (my
wife) <i>and I different persons?</i> lit., Is Roka Roka, and (am) I I?</p>

<p>Sometimes the former verb will assume the form of the verbal noun;
e.&nbsp;g., te haerenga i haere ai, <i>the going with which he went</i>,
i.&nbsp;e., so on he proceeded; na, ko te tino riringa i riri ai, <i>so he
was very angry</i>.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The learned
student need not be reminded of the remarkable parallel which Maori
finds to the four last rules in Hebrew. From this cause it will be
sometimes found that an exactly literal translation will be more
idiomatic than another. Thus Gen. 1, 7, "dying thou shalt die" could
not be rendered more idiomatic than if it be done literally: "na, ko
te matenga e mate ai koe."</p>

<p><i>Of the Passive Verbs.</i>&mdash;It has been already observed (p.p. 49,
56) that passive verbs are often used in Maori in a somewhat more
extended sense than is met with in most languages. It may naturally,
therefore, be expected that their use should be more frequent than
that of active verbs: and such we believe to be the case,&mdash;Maori
seeming to incline peculiarly to the passive mode or form of
statement, especially in the secondary clauses of a sentence.
Independently of other uses which they subserve, (such as often
supplying a more animated style of narration, being sometimes the more
convenient&mdash;as being the more loose or general&mdash;mode in which to
advance a sentiment, &amp;c.), there are two of considerable importance
which may be here noticed. 1st. They are most frequently employed when
the relative pronoun is understood, and are generally <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_161" id="page_161">{161}</a></span>equivalent to the active
verb with <i>ai</i> or <i>nei</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>, after it; e.&nbsp;g.,
nga mahi i wakahaua e ia, <i>the works which were ordered by him</i>. The
active form here, without <i>ai</i> after it, would be seldom used. Vid.
also, the examples p.p. 49, 51. 2ndly. They sometimes supply the place
of a preposition; e.&nbsp;g., he aha te mea e <i>omakia</i> nei? <i>what is
the matter</i> <span class="smcap">about which</span> <i>it is being run?</i>
Te tangata i <i>korerotia</i> nei, <i>the man about whom we were talking</i>.
The following sentence, ka korero ahau ki te whakapakoko, literally
means, <i>I will talk to the image</i>; it should have been, ka korero<i>tia</i>
te whakapakoko. This usage, however, does not extend to all the
prepositions; and, when some of them are understood, the verb will
require <i>ai</i> after it. The following sentence, for example, is
erroneous: te tangata e kainga ana te poaka,<i>the man by whom the pig
is eaten</i>; it should be <i>e</i> kai <i>ana</i>, or <i>e</i> kai <i>nei</i>,
or <i>e</i> kainga <i>ai</i>.</p>

<p>Constructions will not unfrequently be found in which the active form
usurps the place of the passive, and vice versa; e.&nbsp;g., Ko tena kua
hohoro te <i>horoi</i>, <i>let that be first washed</i>; kua
<i>tahu</i> te kai o te kainga nei, <i>the food of the settlement has
been kindled</i>, i.&nbsp;e., the oven is kindled for cooking; Kei te
<i>uta</i> to matou waka, <i>our canoe is loading</i>; Ko tehea te
<i>patu</i>? <i>which is to be killed?</i> ko tera kua <i>panga</i>
noa ake, <i>that has been much longer on the fire</i>: lit., has been
thrown; taria e <i>kawhaki</i> te poti, <i>let not the boat be taken
away (by you) for a while</i>; he mea <i>tiki</i>, <i>a thing
fetched</i>; kua oti te <i>keri</i>, <i>it is finished, the being
dug</i>; me <i>wero</i> e koe, <i>it must be</i> (or, <i>let it
be</i>) <i>stabbed by you</i>; ka timata tena whenua, te <i>tua</i>,
<i>that land has commenced</i> (I mean) <i>the being felled</i>; kei
reira, a Hone e <i>tanu</i> ana, <i>there John (lies) buried</i>;
<i>Ka te arai</i> taku ahi e koe, <i>my fire is being stopped up by
you</i>, i.&nbsp;e., you are intercepting the communication, &amp;c.; kia rua
nga waka e <i>hoe</i> mai e koe, <i>let there be</i> <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_162" id="page_162">{162}</a></span><i>two canoes that will be
paddled here by you</i>. The following form is not frequent:&mdash;kei te
atawhaitia, <i>it the (pig) is being taken care of</i>; kei te takina te
kai, <i>the food is being taken off (the fire)</i>. When ambiguity might
arise from the object of the action being considered as the <i>agent</i>,
the passive form is almost always used; e.&nbsp;g., ka poto nga
tangata o reira <i>te kitea</i>, <i>when all the men of that place have been
seen</i>; ka tata tena tangata te nehua, <i>that man is near being buried</i>.</p>

<p><i>Neuter Verbs which assume the passive form.</i>&mdash;Some
neuter verbs assume the passive form (1) without any material
alteration of meaning; e.&nbsp;g., ka <i>hokia</i> he huanga, <i>if it
is come backwards and forwards to you, it is because I am a
relation</i>.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="R_46" id="R_46"
href="#F_46">[46]</a></span> (2.) Most frequently, however, they
derive a transitive meaning from the change. Thus, in the example
already adduced, page 50, horihori, <i>to tell falsehoods</i>; te mea
i horihoria e koe he tangata, <i>the thing which you erroneously said
was a man</i>. Again,&mdash;Tangi, <i>to cry</i>: te tupapaku e
<i>tangihia</i> nei, <i>the corpse which is being cried</i>,
i.&nbsp;e., which is the subject of the crying; he tangata haurangi,
<i>a mad person</i>; te tangata i haurangitia nei, <i>a person for
whom another is bewildered</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_38" id="F_38" href="#R_38">[38]</a>&#8195;
It is true that when <i>kua</i> represents the pluperfect, or the
priority of one action to another, it may be frequently found in
connexion with <i>ko</i>. But this, we think, is a further
confirmation of the distinction for which we contend. For the
expression "<i>he had loved us</i>" is clearly more definite than
"<i>he loved us</i>,"&mdash;the former implying that that affection
had been entertained <i>before some past act</i>,&mdash;the latter
simply affirming that it was entertained, without reference to any
date. <i>Ko</i> we defined, page 106, as the article of specification
and emphasis, and it is quite natural that it should be associated
with a perfect to denote a pluperfect,&mdash;its office, in such a
construction, being to point out the individual who may be
emphatically said to <i>have</i> performed the act&mdash;whose was the
act which was antecedent, or past. The sentence "ko ia kua atawhai,"
means <i>he is the person who was first kind</i>. This emphatic use of
the word <i>ko</i> has been already illustrated under the head of
<i>comparison, adjectives</i>; the sentence "<i>ko</i> tenei te nui o
nga rakau" meaning <i>this is the large one of the trees</i>;
i.&nbsp;e., this is the one of which we may (emphatically) say, <i>It
is large</i>. So, also, in the following,&mdash;"akuanei <i>ko</i>
Hone <i>kua</i> tae," the meaning is <i>presently</i>, it will be John
who (emphatically) <span class="smcap">has got</span> <i>there</i>;
i.&nbsp;e., John will have got there first.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_39" id="F_39" href="#R_39">[39]</a>&#8195;
The student will see in this, and the other examples, that the noun,
as is very usual in Maori, assumes the form of a verb. To translate
literally such verbs into English is often impossible.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_40" id="F_40" href="#R_40">[40]</a>&#8195;
Following is a connected view of some of the principal means by which
the defect of the substantive verb is <i>sup</i>plied or
<i>im</i>plied, in Maori: he kuri tenei <i>this</i> is <i>a dog</i>.
Tenei a Hone, <i>This is John</i>. Tika rawa, <i>it is very
correct</i>. Ki te <i>whai</i> hau i te po nei, <i>if there be wind in
the night</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> Ki te <i>wa</i> hau, &amp;c.,
<i>idem</i>. Ka <i>ai</i> au hei kianga mai mau, I <i>am for an
ordering for you</i>, i.&nbsp;e., You find in me one that will obey,
&amp;c. <i>Waiho</i>, and sometimes <i>meinga</i>, are often used
instead of <i>ai</i>. E <i>ai</i> ki tana, <i>it is according to
his</i>, i.&nbsp;e., as he affirms.</p>

<p class="nodent">The following form is worthy of notice, Rokohanga
rawatanga atu e ahau, <i>ko</i> Raiana! <i>on my reaching (that
place)</i> there <span class="smcap">was</span> <i>Lion</i>; rokohanga
atu, <i>ko</i> te tahi tangata o Taupo i Maungatautari e noho ana,
<i>when I got (there) there was a man of, &amp;c.</i> Taku hoenga ki
roto <i>ko</i> te waka o Hone, <i>as I was paddling up the river, lo,
there was the canoe of John, &amp;c.</i> Some foreigners, we observe,
use tera taua for this form. We have never heard anything like it in
Waikato. <i>Hei te</i> and <i>ki te</i> (vid. page 62) will often,
also, seem to lose their distinctive meaning in that of the verb
substantive; e.&nbsp;g., <i>hei te</i> pera me tou, <i>let it be like
yours</i>.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_41" id="F_41" href="#R_41">[41]</a>&#8195;
It will also be recollected that the gerunds and participles will, in
that language, often subserve the same office. Thus we have, ante
domandum, <i>before they are tamed</i>; urit videndo, <i>he burns when
he looks</i>; cum Epicurus voluptate metiens summum bonum, <i>whereas
Epicurus who measures the chief good by pleasure</i>.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_42" id="F_42" href="#R_42">[42]</a>&#8195;
This is an exception to what we find in English, and other languages,
the finite verb in them being very seldom found after an oblique case;
i.&nbsp;e., after any case beside the nominative, unless the relative,
or the personal pronoun with some conjunction, intervene. We may
observe, also, that the verbal particles will be often prefixed to
other words beside the verb; e.&nbsp;g., e kore koe e pai <i>kia
mau</i> e hanga? <i>Are you not willing that you should do it?</i>
<i>kia mou</i> ai te kainga, <i>that the land should be yours</i>.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_43" id="F_43" href="#R_43">[43]</a>&#8195;
That the English language had once a similar tendency might, we think,
be shewn by many examples. Thus we hear, "<i>have</i> pity on me,"
"<i>have</i> her forth," "I <i>have</i> remembrance of thee in my
prayer." Many of our tenses, also, are formed by this auxiliary;
e.&nbsp;g., "<i>I have seen</i>," "he <i>had</i> gone," "I would
<i>have</i> loved, &amp;c." The frequent use, also, of this form in
the Greek may be seen in Donnegan's Greek Lexicon, under
"<i>echo</i>," to hold.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_44" id="F_44" href="#R_44">[44]</a>&#8195;
As the English language supplies but few illustrations of this mode of
construction, we will here lay before the student some extracts from
Professor Lee's Hebrew Grammar, as well to shew how much this usage
obtains in Oriental languages, as to enable him to enter more readily
into the subject. Professor L. says, page 328, "any writer commencing
his narrative, will necessarily speak of past, present, or future
events with reference to the period in which his statement is made."
This, he says, is the "<i>absolute</i> use of the tense." Again, "A
person may speak of those events with reference to some other period,
or event, already introduced into the context. This is the
<i>relative</i> use&mdash;Hence, a preterite connected with another
preterite will be equivalent to our pluperfect; a present following a
preterite to our imperfect, and so on." Again, page 330, "They, the
Arabians, consider the present tense as of two kinds; one they term
the <i>real present</i>, which is what our grammarians always
understand by the <i>present tense</i>. The other they term <i>the
present as to the narration</i>; by which they mean the time
contemporary with any event, and which may therefore be considered as
present <i>with it</i>, although past, present, or future with regard
to the <i>real</i> or <i>absolute</i> present tense." In page 334 is a
good illustration from the Persian: "last night I <i>go</i> to the
house of a friend, and there <i>see</i> a delightful assembly, and
<i>enjoy</i> a most pleasing spectacle." The student will see in the
above example that <i>go</i>, <i>see</i>, and <i>enjoy</i>, are
<i>relative presents</i>, being presents to <i>last night</i>, the
time in which the speaker, in his imagination, now places himself.
This mode of construction abounds in the O. and N. T., vid., for
example, Mark xiv., <i>he saw Levi and says to him</i>. <i>Says</i>,
here, is present to <i>saw</i>, though past to the time of the
narration.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_45" id="F_45" href="#R_45">[45]</a>&#8195;
<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The student is recommended to
notice the various forms contained in the preceding table, and to
endeavour to add to them from his own observation. It would also be
most useful to throw into one form all the various examples of simple
and compound times that he will find in pages 37, 41, to 44, as well
also as those contained in the preceding part of this chapter.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_46" id="F_46" href="#R_46">[46]</a>&#8195;
The passive verbs wheterongia, titahangia, &amp;c., to which we
allude, page 39, note, may, we think, on reflection, be most correctly
reduced to this head.</p>

<h2><span class="fs80">CHAPTER XX.</span><br />OF THE PREPOSITIONS,
ADVERBS, AND CONJUNCTIONS.</h2>

<p>These have been considered at large in chapters 8, 9, 10, 11, and
require now but little notice. We proceed to consider the prepositions
which follow the verbs, and to offer a few other remarks respecting
them.</p>

<p><i>Verbal postfixes.</i>&mdash;An active verb will (as was observed page
60) take <i>i</i> after it, to denote the object of the action.
Sometimes, however, <i>ki</i> will be found to supply its place; e.&nbsp;g.,
mohio <i>ki</i> a ia, matau <i>ki</i> a ia, wehi <i>ki</i> a ia,
whakaaro <i>ki</i> tena mea, karanga <i>ki</i> a ia, kua mau <i>ki</i>
te pu, <i>seized his gun</i>. Whiwhi <i>ki</i> te toki, <i>obtain an
axe</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Between these two prepositions, however, as verbal postfixes, there
is often a very important difference; e.&nbsp;g., na ka whakatiki ahau
<i>i</i> a ia <i>ki</i> te kai, <i>so I deprived him of food</i>,
i.&nbsp;e., I withheld food from him; na te aha koe i kaiponu ai
<i>i</i> to paraikete <i>ki</i> a au? <i>why did you withhold your
blanket</i> <span class="smcap">from</span> <i>me?</i> he pakeha hei
whakawhiwhi <i>i</i> a matou <i>ki</i> te kakahu, <i>an European to
make us possess clothes</i>; ki te hoko atu <i>i</i> taku poaka
<i>ki</i> te tahi paraikete moku, <i>to sell my pig for a blanket for
myself</i>. Europeans generally <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_164"
id="page_164">{164}</a></span>employ <i>mo</i>, but erroneously.
Sometimes other prepositions will occupy the place of <i>i</i>; ka
haere ahau ki te whangai i taku kete riwai <i>ma</i> taku poaka, <i>I
will go feed my basket of potatoes for my pig</i>, i.&nbsp;e., I will
feed my pigs with my basket of potatoes; hei patu moku, <i>to strike
me with</i>,&mdash;a form similar to hei patu <i>i</i> a au.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Verbal nouns
will take the same case as their roots. Occasionally no sign of case
will follow the active verb, (1) when the verb is preceded by such
auxiliaries as taea, pau, taihoa, &amp;c., e.&nbsp;g., e kore e taea e
ahau te hopu tena poaka, <i>it cannot be accomplished by me (I mean)
the catching that pig</i>; or, e kore e taea tena <i>poaka</i> e au,
te <i>hopu</i>. (2.) When the verb is preceded by the particle
<i>me</i>, or by the prepositions <i>na</i> and <i>ma</i>; e.&nbsp;g.,
<i>me</i> hopu <i>te poaka</i> e koe, <i>the pig must be caught by
you</i>; <i>na</i>ku i hopu <i>tena</i>, <i>the having caught that
(pig) was mine</i>. To this rule, exceptions are sometimes heard.</p>

<p><i>Neuter Verbs</i> will sometimes take an accusative case of the noun
proper to their own signification; e.&nbsp;g., e karakia ana <i>i tana
karakia</i>, <i>he is praying his prayers</i>; e kakahu ana i ona,
<i>he is garmenting his clothes</i>; i.&nbsp;e., is putting them on.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Considerable
variation will be found in the prepositions which follow such verbs as
heoi, ka tahi, &amp;c.; e.&nbsp;g., heoi ano te koti pai <i>nou</i>, <i>the
only good coat is yours</i>; ka tahi ano te koti pai, <i>nou</i>,
<i>idem</i>; manawa te tangata korero teka, <i>he</i> pakeha
(Taranaki), <i>a European is the greatest person for telling
falsehoods</i>; ka tahi ano taku tangata kino, <i>ko koe</i> (or
<i>ki</i> a koe, or <i>kei</i> a koe); ka tahi ano tenei huarahi ka
takahia <i>ki</i> a koe, <i>you are the first person who has trodden
this path</i>; if it had been <i>e</i> koe, the meaning would have
been <i>you now for the first <span class="smcap">time</span> walk
this road</i>; often, also, the preposition will be omitted, and the
noun put into the nominative; e.&nbsp;g., noho rawa atu <i>he</i>
whenua ke, <i>settled in a foreign land</i>; ka whakamoea atu
<i>he</i> tangata ke, <i>given in marriage to another man</i>; te
huihuinga mai o Mokau, o whea, o whea, <i>ko</i> te Wherowhero, <i>the
musterings of Mokau, &amp;c., &amp;c., are to Wherowhero</i>,
i.&nbsp;e., Wherowhero is the grand object of interest.</p>

<p>Between <i>i</i> and <i>ki</i> when following neuter verbs, or
adjectives, there is often a considerable difference; e.&nbsp;g., mate
<i>ki</i>, <i>desirous of</i>; mate <i>i</i>, <i>killed by</i>; kaha i
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_165" id="page_165">{165}</a></span>te kino,
<i>stronger</i> <span class="smcap">than</span> <i>sin</i>, i.&nbsp;e.,
overcoming it; kaha <i>ki</i> te kino, <i>strong</i>
<span class="smcap">in</span> <i>sinning</i>; ngakau kore
<i>ki</i> tana kupu, <i>disinclined to, &amp;c.</i>; ngakau kore <i>i</i>,
<i>discouraged by</i>.</p>

<p>Foreigners often err in the use of these, and other prepositions;
e.&nbsp;g., i a ia <i>ki</i> reira, <i>while he was there</i>; it
should be, <i>i</i> reira. E aha ana ia <i>ki</i> reira? What is he
doing there? it should be <i>i</i> reira. Kati <i>ki</i> kona; it
should be <i>i</i> kona. E mea ana ahau kia kai <i>i</i> te Onewhero,
<i>I am thinking of taking a meal at Onewhero</i>; it should be,
<i>ki</i> te Onewhero. Hei a wai ranei te pono? hei a Maihi ranei, hei
a Pita ranei? <i>with whom is the truth? with Marsh or with Peter?</i>
it should be, <i>I</i> a wai, &amp;c. He aha te tikanga o taua kupu
nei kei a Matiu? <i>what is the meaning of that expression in
Matthew?</i> it should be <i>i</i> a Matiu. Again,&mdash;kahore he mea
<i>no</i> te kainga nei hei kai, <i>there is nothing in this
settlement for food</i>; it should be, <i>o</i> te kainga nei. Enei
kupu <i>no</i> te pukapuka, <i>these words of the book</i>; it should
be, <i>o</i> te pukapuka. Ko nga mea katoa <i>no</i> waho, <i>all the
things outside</i>; it should be <i>o</i> waho. He kahore urupa
<i>o</i> Kawhia i kawea mai ai ki konei? <i>Was there no grave in
Kawhia that you brought him here?</i> it should be, <i>no</i> Kawhia.
Again,&mdash;he mea tiki <i>i</i> toku whare, <i>a thing fetched from
my house</i>. The meaning of this, as it stands, is "a thing to fetch
my house;" it should be, <i>no</i> toku whare, as in the following
proverb: "he toka hapai mai <i>no</i> nga whenua." In constructions
like these, the agent will take either <i>e</i> or <i>na</i> before
it, but most frequently the latter. In some tribes to the Southward of
Waikato, the following form is in common use:&mdash;he pakeke ou,
<i>yours are hardnesses</i>, i.&nbsp;e., you are a hard person; he
makariri oku i te anu, <i>I have colds from the cold (air)</i>. The
singular forms <i>tou</i> and <i>toku</i> are mostly <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_166" id="page_166">{166}</a></span>used in Waikato, or the
preposition <i>no</i>; e.&nbsp;g., he pakeke <i>nou</i>, and makariri
<i>noku</i>, or <span class="smcap">toku</span>.</p>

<p>Prepositions are sometimes used where a foreigner would expect a
verbal particle; e.&nbsp;g., <i>Kei</i> te takoto a Hone, <i>John is lying
down</i>; <i>i te</i> mate ahau, <i>I was poorly</i>; <i>No</i> te
tarai ahau i tena wahi, <i>I have been hoeing that place</i>. This
form belongs chiefly to Ngapuhi. Ka tae te pakeke o te oneone nei!
kahore <i>i te</i> kohatu! How hard this soil is! it is not at a
stone, i.&nbsp;e., it is like a stone. Kahore ahau <i>i te</i> kite, <i>I
don't see</i>. This last form is used chiefly in the districts
Southward of Waikato.</p>

<p><i>Adverbs.</i>&mdash;Most of the adverbs will (as was observed, page 85)
assume the form of the word with which they are connected; e.&nbsp;g.,
rap<i>u</i> mar<i>ie</i>, rap<i>ua</i> marie<i>tia</i>, rapu<i>nga</i>
marie<i>tanga</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> In some districts, however, they will
assume the form of the verbal noun, after the passive voice; e.&nbsp;g.,
rapua marie<i>tanga</i>. Instances will, also, occasionally be found
in all parts of the island in which they undergo no change; e.&nbsp;g.,
whiua <i>pena</i>, <i>throw it in that direction</i>. Whiua
<i>penatia</i> is, <i>throw it in that manner</i>.</p>

<p><i>Negative Adverbs.</i>&mdash;Most of these will, when in
connexion with the verb, take a verbal particle before, or after,
them; e.&nbsp;g., <i>hore</i> rawa <i>kia</i> pai; kahore i pai, or
(sometimes), kahore <i>e</i> pai; kihai <i>i</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="R_47" id="R_47" href="#F_47">[47]</a></span>
pai; <i>e</i> kore <i>e</i> pai; aua <i>e</i> haere, kiano <i>i</i>
haere noa, <i>e</i> hara i a au, <i>it is not mine</i>, or, <i>it is
different from me</i> (i.&nbsp;e., it was not I), &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Kihai i</i> and <i>kahore i</i> are most frequently used
indifferently one for the other. An experienced <span class="pagenum"><a
name="page_167" id="page_167">{167}</a></span>speaker will, however,
we think, sometimes notice points of difference, and particularly that
<i>kihai i</i> is most frequently employed when reference is made to an
act previous to a past act, and <i>kahore i</i> when some allusion is made
to the present time. Thus, in the following sentence, nau i kai nga
kai <i>kihai nei i</i> tika kia kainga e te mea noa, we should prefer
<i>kahore nei i</i> to denote <i>which</i> <span class="smcap">was</span>
<i>not, and</i> <span class="smcap">is</span> <i>not, lawful to be eaten
by a person not tapu</i>. In Waikato, haunga with kahore sometimes
governs a genitive case; e.&nbsp;g., <i>Kahore haunga o</i> tena. Kahore,
when it takes a possessive case after it, will require it to be in the
plural number; e.&nbsp;g., Kahore <i>aku</i> moni, <i>I have no money</i>, lit.,
there is a negativeness of my monies. So also the particle <i>u</i>, vid.
page 93.</p>

<p>In answering a question, the answer will always be regulated by the
way in which the question is put, e.&nbsp;g., Kahore i pai? <i>ae</i>;
<i>Was he not willing? Yes</i>; i.&nbsp;e., Yes, he was not willing. If the
answer was intended to be affirmative, the speaker would have said "I
pai ano."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nodent"><a name="F_47" id="F_47" href="#R_47">[47]</a>&#8195;
Some foreigners, we observe, omit the <i>i</i> after
<i>kihai</i>, when it immediately follows it. That this error,
however, arises from the <i>I</i> being blended into the ai of
<i>kihai</i> in the pronunciation is clear from its being distinctly
heard when a word intervenes to prevent elision, as in the following
example:&mdash;<i>kihai</i> ahau <i>i</i> pai.</p>

<p>"It is the only work that has ever been published that is calculated
to give a sound and critical knowledge of Maori. I have constant
reference to it in the publication of the Maori <i>Gazette</i>, and
at all times find it an invaluable assistant."&mdash;<i>George Clarke,
Esq., Aboriginal Protector.</i></p>

<p>"To allow you to suffer loss by the publication of your valuable
grammar, would be to suffer our justice to be called in
question."&mdash;<i>Rev. A. N. Brown, sen., Church Missionary of the
Southern District.</i></p>

<p>"I wish you could afford to carry on your work to another part, and
take in prosody, the native waiatas, proverbs, &amp;c.; but I must not
dictate. You have done well, and your work deserves the praise and
encouragement of every one who feels an interest in the natives and
their language."&mdash;<i>Rev. J. Whiteley, sen. Wesleyan Missionary of
the Southern District.</i></p>

<p>"I think you deserve great credit for your performance, and am sure
that when the language is more known you will hear it. May I thank
you to set my name down as a subscriber for twenty copies of the
whole work."&mdash;<i>Rev. O. Hadfield, Senior Church Missionary of the
Port Nicholson District.</i></p>
